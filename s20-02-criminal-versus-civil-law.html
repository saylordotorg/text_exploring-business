    <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch16_s02_p01">In the case of George McGovern and his Stratford Inn, we saw what sort of legal entanglements could discourage even a veteran lawmaker from pursuing a modest dream of business ownership. What about you? How easily discouraged would you be? Put yourself in the following scenario, which could happen to anybody:</p>
    <span class="blockquote block" id="collins-ch16_s02_bl01">
        <p class="para editable" id="collins-ch16_s02_p02">“When you were in high school, you worked part time and over the summers for your father, a house painter. Now that you’re in college, you’ve decided to take advantage of that experience to earn some money during your summer vacation. You set yourself up as a house-painting business and hire your college roommate to help you out. One fine summer day, the two of you are putting a coat of Misty Meadow acrylic latex on the exterior of a two-story Colonial. You’re working on the ground floor around the door of the house while your roommate is working from scaffolding over the garage. Looking up, you notice that, despite several warnings, your roommate has placed his can of paint at his feet rather than fixed it to the ladder bracing the platform. You’re about to say something yet one more time, but it’s too late: He accidentally kicks the bucket (so to speak), which bounces off the homeowner’s red sports car, denting the hood and splattering it with Misty Meadow. As luck would have it, the whole episode is witnessed by the homeowner’s neighbor, who approaches the scene of the disaster just as your roommate has climbed down from the scaffold. “Man, you must be dumber than a bag of hammers,” says the neighbor to your roommate, who’s in no mood for unsolicited opinions, and before you know what’s happening, he breaks the neighbor’s nose with a single well-placed punch.</p>
        <p class="para editable" id="collins-ch16_s02_p03">“The homeowner sues you and your roommate for negligence, and the neighbor sues you and your roommate for assault and battery.”<span class="footnote" id="fwk-collins-fn16_007">This case is inspired by John Jude Moran, <em class="emphasis">Employment Law: New Challenges in the Business Environment</em> (Upper Saddle River, NJ: Pearson Education, 2008), 27.</span></p>

    <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch16_s02_p04">Clearly, being an employer—even of just one person—isn’t nearly as simple as you thought it would be. What should you have known about the basics of <em class="emphasis">employment law</em> in the state where you intended to paint houses? What should you have known about <em class="emphasis">tort law</em>? What about <em class="emphasis">tax law</em>? If you have to pay damages as a result of the homeowner’s negligence claim, can you at least deduct them as business expenses?</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch16_s02_p05">Welcome to the <em class="emphasis">legal environment of business</em>—the place where business interacts with the legal system. Besides the fact that these interactions are usually quite complicated, what valuable lessons should you learn from your experience once your case has been <em class="emphasis">adjudicated</em> (resolved in court)? You probably won’t be surprised to learn that your roommate is liable for negligence in kicking over the paint bucket, but you may be dismayed to learn that you are, too. When it comes to the claim of assault and battery, your roommate is also liable for that, but you may be protected from liability. As for the damages that you’ll probably have to pay in order to settle the homeowner’s negligence suit, you’ll be pleased to learn that you can indeed write them off as “ordinary” business expenses (unless they’re paid by your insurance company).</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch16_s02_p06">As we work our way through this chapter, we’ll look a little more closely at the types of law involved in your case, but we’ll start by observing that, in at least one respect, your roommate’s predicament can be more instructive than yours. That’s because assault and battery violates statutes established by two different types of law—<em class="emphasis">criminal</em> and <em class="emphasis">civil</em>.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Criminal Law</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch16_s02_s01_p01">It’s a <em class="emphasis">crime</em> to make unauthorized and harmful physical contact with another person (<em class="emphasis">battery</em>).

        <h2 class="title editable block">Civil Law</h2>

In civil cases, the <em class="emphasis">plaintiff</em> sues the <em class="emphasis">defendant</em> to obtain compensation for some wrong that the defendant has allegedly done the plaintiff. Thus your roommate may be sued for monetary damages by the homeowner’s neighbor, with whom he made unauthorized and harmful physical contact.</p>
        <div class="section" id="collins-ch16_s02_s02_s01">
            <h2 class="title editable block">Tort Law</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch16_s02_s02_s01_p01">Complaints of assault and battery fall under a specific type of civil law called <em class="emphasis">tort law</em>.

<em class="emphasis">Intentional torts against property</em> may take three forms: (1) entering another person’s land or placing an object on another person’s land without the owner’s permission; (2) interfering with another person’s use or enjoyment of personal property; or (3) permanently removing property from the rightful owner’s possession.</li>
                    <li>
<em class="emphasis">Intentional torts against economic interests</em> are the most common torts when it comes to disputes in business. The three most important forms are (1) making a false statement of material fact about a business product; (2) enticing someone to breach a valid contract; and (3) going into business for the sole purpose of taking business from another concern (i.e., not for the purpose of making a profit).</li>

                <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch16_s02_s02_s01_s01_p05">As we indicated, your roommate may have committed assault and battery in violation of both criminal and civil statutes. Consequently, he may be in double trouble: not only may he be sued for a civil offense by the homeowner’s neighbor, but he may also be prosecuted for a criminal offense by the proper authority in the state where the incident took place. It’s also conceivable that he may be sued but not prosecuted, or vice versa. Everything is up to the discretion of the complaining parties—the homeowner’s neighbor in the civil case and the prosecutor’s office in the criminal case.</p>
                <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch16_s02_s02_s01_s01_p06">Why might one party decide to pursue a case while the other decides not to? A key factor might be the difference in the burden of proof placed on each potential plaintiff. Liability in civil cases may be established by a <em class="emphasis">preponderance of the evidence</em>—the weight of evidence necessary for a judge or jury to decide in favor of the plaintiff (or the defendant). Guilt in criminal cases, however, must be established by <em class="emphasis">proof beyond a reasonable doubt</em>—doubt based on reason and common sense after careful, deliberate consideration of all the pertinent evidence. Criminal guilt thus carries a tougher standard of proof than civil liability, and it’s conceivable that even though the plaintiff in the civil case believes that he can win by a preponderance of the evidence, the prosecutor may feel that she can’t prove criminal guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>
                <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch16_s02_s02_s01_s01_p07">Finally, note that your roommate would be more likely to face criminal prosecution if he had committed assault and battery with <em class="emphasis">criminal intent</em>—with the intent, say, to kill or rob the homeowner’s neighbor or to intimidate him from testifying about the accident with the paint bucket. In that case, in most jurisdictions, his action would be not only a crime but a <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">felony</a><span class="glossdef">Serious or “inherently evil” crime punishable by imprisonment.</span></span>—a serious or “inherently evil” crime punishable by imprisonment.

                        <li>The <em class="emphasis">legal environment of business</em> is the area in which business interacts with the legal system.</li>
                        <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Criminal law</strong> prohibits and punishes wrongful conduct. The <strong class="emphasis bold">plaintiff</strong>—the party filing the complaint—is usually a government body acting as a representative of society. The <strong class="emphasis bold">defendant</strong>—the party charged in the complaint—may be an individual or an organization. Criminal punishment includes fines, imprisonment, or both. <strong class="emphasis bold">Civil law</strong> refers to law governing disputes between private parties. In civil cases, the plaintiff sues the defendant to obtain compensation for some wrong that the defendant has allegedly done the plaintiff.</li>
                        <li>Tort law covers <strong class="emphasis bold">torts</strong>, or civil wrongs—injuries done to someone’s person or property. The punishment in tort cases is the monetary compensation that the court orders the defendant to pay the plaintiff.</li>
                        <li>An <strong class="emphasis bold">intentional tort</strong> is an intentional act that poses harm to the plaintiff. Intentional torts may be committed against a person, a person’s property, or a person’s economic interests. In addition to intentional torts, the law recognizes <em class="emphasis">negligence torts</em> and <em class="emphasis">strict liability torts</em>.</li>
                        <li>Liability in civil cases may be established by a <em class="emphasis">preponderance of the evidence</em>—the weight of evidence necessary for a judge or jury to decide in favor of the plaintiff (or the defendant). Guilt in criminal cases must be established by <em class="emphasis">proof beyond a reasonable doubt</em>—doubt based on reason and common sense after careful, deliberate consideration of all the pertinent evidence.</li>
                        <li>A crime may be a <strong class="emphasis bold">felony</strong>—a serious or “inherently evil” crime punishable by imprisonment—or a <strong class="emphasis bold">misdemeanor</strong>—a crime that’s not “inherently evil” but that is nevertheless prohibited by society.</li>

                    <p class="para" id="collins-ch16_s02_s02_s01_s01_p09">You own a moving company. One of your workers let go of a chair he was carrying up a staircase. Unfortunately, a tenant of the building was walking up the stairs at the time and was seriously hurt in the incident. Can your company be sued? Would the case fall under criminal or civil law?</p>
                    <p class="para" id="collins-ch16_s02_s02_s01_s01_p10">Now, let’s say that your worker was going up the stairs with a chair when the tenant yelled at him for blocking her way. In anger, your worker threw the chair at her and cases serious harm. What actions can be taken against your employee?</p>
