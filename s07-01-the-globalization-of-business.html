    <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch03_s01_p01">The globalization of business is bound to affect you. Not only will you buy products manufactured overseas, but it’s highly likely that you’ll meet and work with individuals from various countries and cultures as customers, suppliers, colleagues, employees, or employers. The bottom line is that the globalization of world commerce has an impact on all of us. Therefore, it makes sense to learn more about how globalization works.</p>

    <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch03_s01_p02">Never before has business spanned the globe the way it does today. But why is international business important? Why do companies and nations engage in international trade? What strategies do they employ in the global marketplace? What challenges do companies face when they do business overseas? How do governments and international agencies promote and regulate international trade? Is the globalization of business a good thing? What career opportunities are there for you in global business? How should you prepare yourself to take advantage of them? These are the questions that we’ll be addressing in this chapter. Let’s start by looking at the more specific reasons why companies and nations engage in international trade.</p>
    <div class="section" id="collins-ch03_s01_s01">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Why Do Nations Trade?</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch03_s01_s01_p01">Why does the United States import automobiles, steel, digital phones, and apparel from other countries? Why don’t we just make them ourselves? Why do other countries buy wheat, chemicals, machinery, and consulting services from us? Because no national economy produces all the goods and services that its people need. Countries are <em class="emphasis">importers</em> when they buy goods and services from other countries; when they sell products to other nations, they’re <em class="emphasis">exporters</em>. (We’ll discuss importing and exporting in greater detail later in the chapter.) The monetary value of international trade is enormous. In 2007, the total value of worldwide trade in merchandise and commercial services was $16.8 <em class="emphasis">trillion</em>.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-collins-fn03_001">World Trade Organization, press release, “WTO: developing, transition economies cushion trade slowdown,” April 17, 2008 (accessed November 1, 2008).</span></p>

    <div class="section" id="collins-ch03_s01_s02">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Absolute and Comparative Advantage</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch03_s01_s02_p01">To understand why certain countries import or export certain products, you need to realize that every country (or region) can’t produce the same products. The cost of labor, the availability of natural resources, and the level of know-how vary greatly around the world. Most economists use the concepts of <em class="emphasis">absolute advantage</em> and <em class="emphasis">comparative advantage</em> to explain why countries import some products and export others.</p>
        <div class="section" id="collins-ch03_s01_s02_s01">
            <h2 class="title editable block">Absolute Advantage</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch03_s01_s02_s01_p01">A nation has an <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">absolute advantage</a><span class="glossdef">Condition whereby a country is the only source of a product or is able to make more of a product using the same or fewer resources than other countries.</span></span> if (1) it’s the only source of a particular product or (2) it can make more of a product using the same amount of or fewer resources than other countries. Because of climate and soil conditions, for example, Brazil has an absolute advantage in coffee beans and France has an absolute advantage in wine production. Unless, however, an absolute advantage is based on some limited natural resource, it seldom lasts. That’s why there are few examples of absolute advantage in the world today. Even France’s dominance of worldwide wine production, for example, is being challenged by growing wine industries in Italy, Spain, and the United States.</p>

        <div class="section" id="collins-ch03_s01_s02_s02">
            <h2 class="title editable block">Comparative Advantage</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch03_s01_s02_s02_p01">How can we predict, for any given country, which products will be made and sold at home, which will be imported, and which will be exported? This question can be answered by looking at the concept of <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">comparative advantage</a><span class="glossdef">Condition whereby one nation is able to produce a product at a lower opportunity cost compared to another nation.</span></span>, which exists when a country can produce a product at a lower opportunity cost compared to another nation. But what’s an <em class="emphasis">opportunity cost</em>? Opportunity costs are the products that a country must decline to make in order to produce something else. When a country decides to specialize in a particular product, it must sacrifice the production of another product.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch03_s01_s02_s02_p02">Let’s simplify things by imagining a world with only two countries—the Republic of High Tech and the Kingdom of Low Tech. Each country knows how to make two and only two products: wooden boats and telescopes. Each country spends half its resources (labor and capital) on each good. <a class="xref" href="#collins-ch03_s01_s02_s02_f01">Figure 3.3 "Comparative Advantage in the Techs"</a> shows the daily output for both countries. (They’re not highly productive, as we’ve imagined two <em class="emphasis">very</em> small countries.)</p>
            <div class="figure large editable block" id="collins-ch03_s01_s02_s02_f01">
                <p class="title"><span class="title-prefix">Figure 3.3</span> Comparative Advantage in the Techs</p>

            </div>
            <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch03_s01_s02_s02_p03">First, note that High Tech has an <em class="emphasis">absolute</em> advantage in both boats and telescopes: it can make more boats (three versus two) and more telescopes (nine versus one) than Low Tech can with the same resources. So, why doesn’t High Tech make <em class="emphasis">all</em> the boats and <em class="emphasis">all</em> the telescopes needed for <em class="emphasis">both</em> countries? Because it lacks sufficient resources and must, therefore, decide how much of its resources to devote to each of the two goods. Assume, for example, that each country could devote 100 percent of its resources on <em class="emphasis">either</em> of the two goods. Start with boats. If both countries spend <em class="emphasis">all</em> their resources on boats (and make no telescopes), here’s what happens:</p>
            <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="collins-ch03_s01_s02_s02_l01">
                <li>High Tech makes, for example, three more boats but gives up the opportunity to make the nine telescopes; thus the opportunity cost of making <em class="emphasis">each</em> boat is three telescopes (9 ÷ 3 = 3).</li>
                <li>Low Tech makes, for example, two more boats but gives up the opportunity to make one telescope; thus the opportunity cost of making <em class="emphasis">each</em> boat is half a telescope (1 ÷ 2 = 1/2).</li>
                <li>Low Tech, therefore, enjoys a <em class="emphasis">lower opportunity cost</em>: Because it must give up less to make the extra boats, it has a comparative advantage for boats. And because it’s better—that is, more efficient—at making boats than at making telescopes, it should specialize in boat making.</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch03_s01_s02_s02_p04">Now to telescopes. Here’s what happens if each country spends all its time making telescopes and makes no boats:</p>
            <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="collins-ch03_s01_s02_s02_l02">
                <li>High Tech makes, for example, nine more telescopes but gives up the opportunity to make three boats; thus, the opportunity cost of making <em class="emphasis">each</em> telescope is one third of a boat (3 ÷ 9 = 1/3).</li>
                <li>Low Tech makes, for example, one more telescope but gives up the opportunity to make two boats; thus, the opportunity cost of making <em class="emphasis">each</em> telescope is two boats (2 ÷ 1 = 2).</li>
                <li>In this case, High Tech has the <em class="emphasis">lower opportunity cost</em>: Because it had to give up less to make the extra telescopes, it enjoys a comparative advantage for telescopes. And because it’s better—more efficient—at making telescopes than at making boats, it should specialize in telescope making.</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch03_s01_s02_s02_p05">Each country will specialize in making the good for which it has a comparative advantage—that is, the good that it can make most efficiently, relative to the other country. High Tech will devote its resources to telescopes (which it’s good at making), and Low Tech will put its resources into boat making (which it does well). High Tech will export its excess telescopes to Low Tech, which will pay for the telescopes with the money it earns by selling its excess boats to High Tech. Both countries will be better off.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch03_s01_s02_s02_p06">Things are a lot more complex in the real world, but, generally speaking, nations trade to exploit their advantages. They benefit from specialization, focusing on what they do best, and trading the output to other countries for what <em class="emphasis">they</em> do best. The United States, for instance, is increasingly an exporter of knowledge-based products, such as software, movies, music, and professional services (management consulting, financial services, and so forth). America’s colleges and universities, therefore, are a source of comparative advantage, and students from all over the world come to the United States for the world’s best higher-education system.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch03_s01_s02_s02_p07">France and Italy are centers for fashion and luxury goods and are leading exporters of wine, perfume, and designer clothing. Japan’s engineering expertise has given it an edge in such fields as automobiles and consumer electronics. And with large numbers of highly skilled graduates in technology, India has become the world’s leader in low-cost, computer-software engineering.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">How Do We Measure Trade between Nations?</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch03_s01_s03_p01">To evaluate the nature and consequences of its international trade, a nation looks at two key indicators. We determine a country’s <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">balance of trade</a><span class="glossdef">Difference between the value of a nation’s imports and its exports during a specified period.</span></span> by subtracting the value of its imports from the value of its exports. If a country sells more products than it buys, it has a favorable balance, called a <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">trade surplus</a><span class="glossdef">Condition whereby a country sells more products than it buys, resulting in a favorable trade balance.</span></span>. If it buys more than it sells, it has an unfavorable balance, or a <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">trade deficit</a><span class="glossdef">Condition whereby a country buys more products than it sells, resulting in an unfavorable trade balance.</span></span>.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch03_s01_s03_p02">For many years, the United States has had a trade deficit: we buy far more goods from the rest of the world than we sell overseas. This fact shouldn’t be surprising. With high income levels, we not only consume a sizable portion of our own domestically produced goods but enthusiastically buy imported goods. Other countries, such as China and Taiwan, which manufacture primarily for export, have large trade surpluses because they sell far more goods overseas than they buy.</p>
        <div class="section" id="collins-ch03_s01_s03_s01">
            <h2 class="title editable block">Managing the National Credit Card</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch03_s01_s03_s01_p01">Are trade deficits a bad thing? Not necessarily. They can be positive if a country’s economy is strong enough both to keep growing and to generate the jobs and incomes that permit its citizens to buy the best the world has to offer. That was certainly the case in the United States in the 1990s. Some experts, however, are alarmed at our rapidly accelerating trade deficit. Investment guru Warren Buffet, for example, cautions that no country can continuously sustain large and burgeoning trade deficits. Why not? Because creditor nations will eventually stop taking IOUs from debtor nations, and when that happens, the national spending spree will have to cease. “Our national credit card,” he warns, “allows us to charge truly breathtaking amounts. But that card’s credit line is not limitless.”<span class="footnote" id="fwk-collins-fn03_002">Warren E. Buffet, “Why I’m Not Buying the U.S. Dollar,” <em class="emphasis">Wall Street Week with Fortune</em>, <a class="link" href="http://www.pbs.org/wsw/news/fortunearticle_20031026_03.html">http://www.pbs.org/wsw/news/fortunearticle_20031026_03.html</a> (accessed May 25, 2006).</span></p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch03_s01_s03_s01_p02">By the same token, trade surpluses aren’t necessarily good for a nation’s consumers. Japan’s export-fueled economy produced high economic growth in the 1970s and 1980s. But most domestically made consumer goods were priced at artificially high levels inside Japan itself—so high, in fact, that many Japanese traveled overseas to buy the electronics and other high-quality goods on which Japanese trade was dependent. CD players and televisions were significantly cheaper in Honolulu or Los Angeles than in Tokyo. How did this situation come about? Though Japan manufactures a variety of goods, many of them are made for export. To secure shares in international markets, Japan prices its exported goods competitively. Inside Japan, because competition is limited, producers can put artificially high prices on Japanese-made goods. Due to a number of factors (high demand for a limited supply of imported goods, high shipping and distribution costs, and other costs incurred by importers in a nation that tends to protect its own industries), imported goods are also expensive.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-collins-fn03_003">“Why Are Prices in Japan So Damn High?” <em class="emphasis">The Japan FAQ</em>, <a class="link" href="http://www.geocities.com/japanfaq/FAQ-Prices.html">http://www.geocities.com/japanfaq/FAQ-Prices.html</a> (accessed May 25, 2006).</span></p>

            <h2 class="title editable block">Balance of Payments</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch03_s01_s03_s02_p01">The second key measure of the effectiveness of international trade is <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">balance of payments</a><span class="glossdef">Difference between the total flow of money coming into a country and the total flow of money going out.</span></span>: the difference, over a period of time, between the total flow of money coming into a country and the total flow of money going out. As in its balance of trade, the biggest factor in a country’s balance of payments is the money that comes in and goes out as a result of imports and exports. But balance of payments includes other cash inflows and outflows, such as cash received from or paid for foreign investment, loans, tourism, military expenditures, and foreign aid. For example, if a U.S. company buys some real estate in a foreign country, that investment counts in the U.S. balance of payments, but not in its balance of trade, which measures only import and export transactions. In the long run, having an unfavorable balance of payments can negatively affect the stability of a country’s currency. Some observers are worried about the U.S. dollar, which has undergone an accelerating pattern of unfavorable balances of payments since the 1970s. For one thing, carrying negative balances has forced the United States to cover its debt by borrowing from other countries.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-collins-fn03_004">Warren E.
