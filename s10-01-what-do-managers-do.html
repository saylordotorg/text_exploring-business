A <em class="emphasis">plan</em> enables you to take your business concept beyond the idea stage. It does not, however, get the work <em class="emphasis">done</em>. You have to <em class="emphasis">organize</em> things if you want your plan to become a reality. You have to put people and other resources in place to make things happen. And because your note-taking venture is supposed to be better off with you in charge, you need to be a <em class="emphasis">leader</em> who can motivate your people to do well. Finally, to know whether things are in fact going well, you’ll have to <em class="emphasis">control</em> your operations—that is, measure the results and compare them with the results that you laid out in your plan. <a class="xref" href="#collins-ch06_s01_f01">Figure 6.3 "The Role of Planning"</a> gives you a good idea of the interrelationship between planning and the other functions that managers perform.</p>

In the rest of the chapter, we’ll look at these four interrelated functions in detail.</p>
