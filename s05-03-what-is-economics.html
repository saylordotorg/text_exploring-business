            <li>Land and other natural resources</li>

        <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch01_s03_s01_p02">Resources are combined to produce goods and services. Land and natural resources provide the needed raw materials. Labor transforms raw materials into goods and services. Capital (equipment, buildings, vehicles, cash, and so forth) are needed for the production process. Entrepreneurship provides the skill and creativity needed to bring the other resources together to capitalize on an idea.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch01_s03_s01_p03">Because a business uses resources to <em class="emphasis">produce</em> things, we also call these resources <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">factors of production</a><span class="glossdef">Resources consisting of land, labor, capital (money, buildings, equipment), and entrepreneurial skills combined to produce goods and services.</span></span>.

        <h2 class="title editable block">Input and Output Markets</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch01_s03_s02_p01">Many of the factors of production (or resources) are provided to businesses by households. For example, households provide businesses with labor (as workers), land and buildings (as landlords), and capital (as investors). In turn, businesses pay households for these resources by providing them with income, such as wages, rent, and interest. The resources obtained from households are then used by businesses to produce goods and services, which are sold to the same households that provide businesses with revenue. The revenue obtained by businesses is then used to buy additional resources, and the cycle continues. This circular flow is described in <a class="xref" href="#collins-ch01_s03_s02_f01">Figure 1.4 "The Circular Flow of Inputs and Outputs"</a>, which illustrates the dual roles of households and businesses:</p>
        <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="collins-ch01_s03_s02_l01">
            <li>Households not only provide factors of production (or resources) but also consume goods and services.</li>
            <li>Businesses not only buy resources but also produce and sell both goods and services.</li>

        <h2 class="title editable block">The Questions Economists Ask</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch01_s03_s03_p01">Economists study the interactions between households and businesses and look at the ways in which the factors of production are combined to produce the goods and services that people need. Basically, economists try to answer three sets of questions:</p>
        <ol class="orderedlist editable block" id="collins-ch01_s03_s03_l01">
            <li>
<em class="emphasis">What goods and services should be produced to meet consumers</em>’ <em class="emphasis">needs</em>? In what quantity? When should they be produced?</li>
            <li>

        </ol>
    </div>
    <div class="section" id="collins-ch01_s03_s04">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Economic Systems</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch01_s03_s04_p01">The answers to these questions depend on a country’s <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">economic system</a><span class="glossdef">Means by which a society makes decisions about allocating resources to produce and distribute products.</span></span>—the means by which a society (households, businesses, and government) makes decisions about allocating resources to produce products and about distributing those products. The degree to which individuals and business owners, as opposed to the government, enjoy freedom in making these decisions varies according to the type of economic system. Generally speaking, economic systems can be divided into two systems: <em class="emphasis">planned systems</em> and <em class="emphasis">free market systems</em>.</p>
        <div class="section" id="collins-ch01_s03_s04_s01">
            <h2 class="title editable block">Planned Systems</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch01_s03_s04_s01_p01">In a planned system, the government exerts control over the allocation and distribution of all or some goods and services. The system with the highest level of government control is <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">communism</a><span class="glossdef">Economic system featuring the highest level of government control over allocation and distribution.</span></span>. In theory, a communist economy is one in which the government owns all or most enterprises. Central planning by the government dictates which goods or services are produced, how they are produced, and who will receive them. In practice, pure communism is practically nonexistent today, and only a few countries (notably North Korea and Cuba) operate under rigid, centrally planned economic systems.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch01_s03_s04_s01_p02">Under <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">socialism</a><span class="glossdef">Economic system falling between communism and capitalism in terms of government control over allocation and distribution.</span></span>, industries that provide essential services, such as utilities, banking, and health care, may be government owned. Other businesses are owned privately. Central planning allocates the goods and services produced by government-run industries and tries to ensure that the resulting wealth is distributed equally. In contrast, privately owned companies are operated for the purpose of making a profit for their owners. In general, workers in socialist economies work fewer hours, have longer vacations, and receive more health, education, and child-care benefits than do workers in capitalist economies. To offset the high cost of public services, taxes are generally steep. Examples of socialist countries include Sweden and France.</p>

As we will see next, in a free market, <em class="emphasis">competition</em> dictates how goods and services will be allocated. Business is conducted with only limited government involvement. The economies of the United States and other countries, such as Japan, are based on capitalism.</p>

            <h2 class="title editable block">How Economic Systems Compare</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch01_s03_s04_s03_p01">In comparing economic systems, it’s helpful to think of a continuum with communism at one end and pure capitalism at the other, as in <a class="xref" href="#collins-ch01_s03_s04_s03_f01">Figure 1.5 "The Spectrum of Economic Systems"</a>. As you move from left to right, the amount of government control over business diminishes. So, too, does the level of social services, such as health care, child-care services, social security, and unemployment benefits.</p>

A <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">mixed market economy</a><span class="glossdef">Economic system that relies on both markets and government to allocate resources.</span></span> relies on both markets and the government to allocate resources. We’ve already seen that this is what happens in socialist economies in which the government controls selected major industries, such as transportation and health care, while allowing individual ownership of other industries. Even previously communist economies, such as those of Eastern Europe and China, are becoming more mixed as they adopt capitalistic characteristics and convert businesses previously owned by the government to private ownership through a process called <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">privatization</a><span class="glossdef">Process of converting government-owned businesses to private ownership.</span></span>.</p>

            <h2 class="title editable block">The U.S. Economic System</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch01_s03_s04_s05_p01">Like most countries, the United States features a mixed market system: though the U.S. economic system is primarily a free market system, the federal government controls some basic services, such as the postal service and air traffic control. The U.S. economy also has some characteristics of a socialist system, such as providing social security retirement benefits to retired workers.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch01_s03_s04_s05_p02">The free market system was espoused by Adam Smith in his book <em class="emphasis">The Wealth of Nations</em>, published in 1776.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-collins-fn01_011">According to many scholars, <em class="emphasis">The Wealth of Nations</em> not only is the most influential book on free-market capitalism but remains relevant today.</span> According to Smith, competition alone would ensure that consumers received the best products at the best prices. In the kind of competition he assumed, a seller who tries to charge more for his product than other sellers won’t be able to find any buyers. A job-seeker who asks more than the going wage won’t be hired. Because the “invisible hand” of competition will make the market work effectively, there won’t be a need to regulate prices or wages.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch01_s03_s04_s05_p03">Almost immediately, however, a tension developed among free market theorists between the principle of <em class="emphasis">laissez-faire</em>—leaving things alone—and government intervention. Today, it’s common for the U.S. government to intervene in the operation of the economic system. For example, government exerts influence on the food and pharmaceutical industries through the Food and Drug Administration, which protects consumers by preventing unsafe or mislabeled products from reaching the market.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch01_s03_s04_s05_p04">To appreciate how businesses operate, we must first get an idea of how prices are set in competitive markets. Thus, the next section begins by describing how markets establish prices in an environment of <em class="emphasis">perfect competition</em>.</p>
