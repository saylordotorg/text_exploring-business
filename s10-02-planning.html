    <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch06_s02_p01">Without a plan, it’s hard to succeed at anything. The reason is simple: if you don’t know where you’re going, you can’t really move forward. Successful managers decide where they want to be and then figure out how to get there. In <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">planning</a><span class="glossdef">Process of setting goals and determining the best way to achieve them.</span></span>, managers set goals and determine the best way to achieve them. As a result of the planning process, everyone in the organization knows what should be done, who should do it, and how it should be done.</p>
    <div class="section" id="collins-ch06_s02_s01">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Developing a Strategic Plan</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch06_s02_s01_p01">Coming up with an idea—say, starting a note-taking business—is a good start, but it’s only a start. Planning for it is a step forward. Planning begins at the highest level and works its way down through the organization. Step one is usually called <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">strategic planning</a><span class="glossdef">Process of establishing an overall plan or course of action for an organization.</span></span>, which is the process of establishing an overall course of action. To begin this process, you should ask yourself a couple of very basic questions: Why, for example, does the organization exist? What value does it create? Sam Walton posed these questions in the process of founding Wal-Mart: his new chain of stores would exist to offer customers the lowest prices with the best possible service.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-collins-fn06_001">Lee Scott, “Three Basic Beliefs,” <em class="emphasis">About Wal-Mart</em>, <a class="link" href="http://www.walmartstores.com/GlobalWMStoresWeb/navigate.do?catg=252">http://www.walmartstores.com/GlobalWMStoresWeb/navigate.do?catg=252</a> (accessed May 3, 2006).</span></p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch06_s02_s01_p02">After you’ve identified the purpose of your company, you’re ready to take the remaining steps in the strategic-planning process:</p>
        <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="collins-ch06_s02_s01_l01">
            <li>Write a mission statement that tells customers, employees, and others why your organization exists.</li>
            <li>Identify core values or beliefs that will guide the behavior of members of the organization.</li>
            <li>Assess the company’s strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats.</li>
            <li>Establish goals and objectives, or performance targets, to direct all the activities that you’ll perform to achieve your mission.</li>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Mission Statement</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch06_s02_s02_p01">As we saw in an earlier chapter, the <em class="emphasis">mission statement</em> describes the purpose of your organization—the reason for its existence. It tells the reader what the organization is committed to doing. It can be very concise, like the one from Mary Kay Inc. (the cosmetics company): “To enrich the lives of women around the world.”<span class="footnote" id="fwk-collins-fn06_002">Mary Kay Inc. Web site, Employment at Mary Kay section, <a class="link" href="http://www.marykay.com/company/jobsatmarykay/default.aspx">http://www.marykay.com/company/jobsatmarykay/default.aspx</a> (accessed November 2, 2008).</span> Or it can be as detailed as the one from Harley-Davidson: “We fulfill dreams through the experience of motorcycling, by providing to motorcyclists and to the general public an expanding line of motorcycles and branded products and services in selected market segments.”<span class="footnote" id="fwk-collins-fn06_003">Harley-Davidson Web site, Company/Student Center section, <a class="link" href="http://www.harley-davidson.com/wcm/Content/Pages/Student_Center/student_center.jsp?locale=en_US#missionstatement">http://www.harley-davidson.com/wcm/Content/Pages/Student_Center/student_center.jsp?locale=en_US#missionstatement</a> (accessed November 2, 2008).</span></p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch06_s02_s02_p02">What about Notes-4-You? What should your mission statement say? A simple, concise mission statement for your enterprise could be the following: “To provide high-quality class notes to college students.” On the other hand, you could prepare a more detailed statement that explains what the company is committed to doing, who its customers are, what its focus is, what goods or services it provides, and how it serves its customers. In that case, your mission statement might be the following:</p>
        <span class="blockquote block" id="collins-ch06_s02_s02_bl01">
            <p class="para editable" id="collins-ch06_s02_s02_p03">“Notes-4-You is committed to earning the loyalty of college students through its focus on customer service. It provides high-quality, dependable, competitively priced class notes that help college students master complex academic subjects.”</p>

    <div class="section" id="collins-ch06_s02_s03">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Core Values</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch06_s02_s03_p01">Having defined your mission, your next step is to ask, What does this organization stand for? What values will define it? What principles should guide our actions as we build and operate the business? In <a class="xref" href="collins-ch02#collins-ch02">Chapter 2 "Business Ethics and Social Responsibility"</a>, we explained that the small set of guiding principles that you identify as crucial to your company are known as <em class="emphasis">core values</em>—fundamental beliefs about what’s important and what is and isn’t appropriate in conducting company activities. Core values affect the overall planning processes and operations. At Volvo, for example, three core values—safety, quality, and environmental care—define the firm’s “approach to product development, design and production.”<span class="footnote" id="fwk-collins-fn06_004">Volvo Cars of North America, “Why Volvo,” <a class="link" href="http://new.volvocars.com/whyvolvo">http://new.volvocars.com/whyvolvo</a> (accessed May 3, 2006).</span> Core values should also guide the behavior of every individual in the organization. Coca-Cola, for instance, reports that its stated core values—honesty, integrity, diversity, quality, respect, responsibility, and accountability—tell employees exactly what behaviors are acceptable. How do companies communicate core values to employees and hold them accountable for putting those values into practice? They link core values to performance evaluations and compensation.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-collins-fn06_005">The Coca-Cola Company, “Code of Business Conduct,” <a class="link" href="http://www2.coca-cola.com/ourcompany/business_conduct.html">http://www2.coca-cola.com/ourcompany/business_conduct.html</a> (accessed May 3, 2006).</span></p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch06_s02_s03_p02">In choosing core values for Notes-4-You, you’re determined not to fall back on some list of the world’s most popular core values: ethics/integrity, accountability, respect for others, and open communication.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-collins-fn06_006">American Management Association, “Ethics and Integrity Are Listed as Core Values by 76% of Companies,” June 26, 2002, <a class="link" href="http://www.amanet.org/press/amanews/corporate_values.htm">http://www.amanet.org/press/amanews/corporate_values.htm</a> (accessed May 3, 2006).</span> You want yours to be unique to Notes-4-You. After some thought, you settle on <em class="emphasis">teamwork, trust</em>, and <em class="emphasis">dependability</em>. Why these three? As you plan your business, you realize that it will need a workforce that functions as a team, trusts each other, and can be depended on to satisfy customers. In building your workforce, you’ll seek employees who’ll embrace these values.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section" id="collins-ch06_s02_s04">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Conduct a SWOT Analysis</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch06_s02_s04_p01">The next step in the strategic-planning process is to assess your company’s fit with its environment. A common approach to <em class="emphasis">environmental analysis</em> is matching the strengths of your business with the opportunities available to it. It’s called <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">SWOT analysis</a><span class="glossdef">Approach used to assess a company’s fit with its environment by analyzing its strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats.</span></span> because it calls for analyzing an organization’s Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, and Threats. It begins with an examination of <em class="emphasis">external</em> factors that could influence the company in either a positive or a negative way. These could include economic conditions, competition, emerging technologies, laws and regulations, and customers’ expectations.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch06_s02_s04_p02">One purpose of assessing the external environment is to identify both <em class="emphasis">opportunities</em> that could benefit the company and <em class="emphasis">threats</em> to its success. For example, a company that manufactures children’s bicycle helmets would view a change in federal law requiring all children to wear helmets as an opportunity. The news that two large sports-equipment companies were coming out with bicycle helmets would be a threat.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch06_s02_s04_p03">The next step is to evaluate the company’s strengths and weaknesses. <em class="emphasis">Strengths</em> might include a motivated workforce, state-of-the-art technology, impressive managerial talent, or a desirable location. The opposite of any of these strengths (poor workforce, obsolete technology, incompetent management, or poor location) could signal a potential <em class="emphasis">weakness</em>. Armed with a good idea of external opportunities and threats, as well as internal strengths and weaknesses, managers want to capitalize on opportunities by taking advantage of organizational strengths. Likewise, they want to protect the organization from both external threats and internal weaknesses.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch06_s02_s04_p04">Let’s start with our strengths. Now that we know what they are, how do we match them with our available opportunities (while also protecting ourselves from our threats and overcoming our weaknesses)? Here’s a possibility: By providing excellent service and price while we’re still small (with few customers and low costs), we can solidify our position on campus. When the market grows (as it will, because of the increase in the number of classes—especially those at 8:00 a.m.—and increases in student enrollment), we’ll have built a strong reputation and will put ourselves in a position to grow. So even if a competitor comes to campus (a threat), we’ll be the preferred supplier of class notes. This strategy will work only if we make sure that our note takers are dependable and that we don’t alienate the faculty or administration.</p>

    <div class="section" id="collins-ch06_s02_s05">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Set Goals and Objectives</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch06_s02_s05_p01">Your mission statement affirms what your organization is <em class="emphasis">generally</em> committed to doing, but it doesn’t tell you <em class="emphasis">how</em> to do it. So the next step in the strategic-planning process is establishing goals and objectives. <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Goals</a><span class="glossdef">Major accomplishments that a company wants to achieve over a long period of time.</span></span> are major accomplishments that the company wants to achieve over a long period (say, five years). <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Objectives</a><span class="glossdef">Intermediate-term performance targets that direct the activities of an organization toward the attainment of a goal.</span></span> are shorter-term performance targets that direct the activities of the organization toward the attainment of a goal. They should be clearly stated, attainable, and measurable: they should give target dates for the completion of tasks and stipulate who’s responsible for taking necessary actions.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-collins-fn06_007">Scott Safranski and Ik-Whan Kwon, “Strategic Planning for the Growing Business” (1991), U.S. Small Business Administration, <a class="link" href="http://www.sba.gov/library/pubs/eb-6.doc">http://www.sba.gov/library/pubs/eb-6.doc</a> (accessed May 3, 2006).</span></p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch06_s02_s05_p02">An organization will have a number of goals and related objectives. Some will focus on financial measures, such as profit maximization and sales growth. Others will target operational efficiency or quality control. Still others will govern the company’s relationships with its employees, its community, its environment, or all three.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch06_s02_s05_p03">Finally, goals and objectives change over time. As a firm reassesses its place in its business environment, it rethinks not only its mission but also its approach to fulfilling it. The reality of change was a major theme when the late McDonald’s CEO Jim Cantalupo explained his goal to revitalize the company:</p>
        <span class="blockquote block" id="collins-ch06_s02_s05_bl01">
            <p class="para editable" id="collins-ch06_s02_s05_p04">“The world has changed. Our customers have changed. We have to change too. Growth comes from being better, not just expanding to have more restaurants. The new McDonald’s is focused on building sales at existing restaurants rather than on adding new restaurants. We are introducing a new level of discipline and efficiency to all aspects of the business and are setting a new bar for performance.”<span class="footnote" id="fwk-collins-fn06_008">McDonald’s Corp., “McDonald’s Announces Plans to Revitalize Its Worldwide Business and Sets New Financial Targets,” <em class="emphasis">McDonald’s Financial Press</em>, April 7, 2003, <a class="link" href="http://www.mcdonalds.com/corp/news/fnpr/2003/fpr04072003.html">http://www.mcdonalds.com/corp/news/fnpr/2003/fpr04072003.html</a> (accessed May 3, 2006).</span></p>
        </span>
        <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch06_s02_s05_p05">This change in focus was accompanied by specific performance objectives—annual sales growth of 3 to 5 percent and income growth of 6 to 7 percent at existing restaurants, plus a five-point improvement (based on customer surveys) in speed of service, friendliness, and food quality.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch06_s02_s05_p06">In setting strategic goals and performance objectives for Notes-4-You, you should keep things simple. Because you know you need to make money to stay in business, you could include a financial goal (and related objectives). Your mission statement promises “high-quality, dependable, competitively priced class notes,” so you could focus on the quality of the class notes that you’ll be taking and distributing. Finally, because your mission is to serve students, one goal could be customer oriented. When all’s said and done, your list of goals and objectives might look like this:</p>
        <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="collins-ch06_s02_s05_l01">

            <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch06_s02_s07_s02_p01">Organizations also face the risk of encountering crises that require immediate attention. Rather than wait until such a crisis occurs and then scrambling to figure out what to do, many firms practice <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">crisis management</a><span class="glossdef">Action plans that outline steps to be taken by a company in case of a crisis.</span></span>. Some, for instance, set up teams trained to deal with emergencies. Members gather information quickly and respond to the crisis while everyone else carries out his or her normal duties. The team also keeps the public, the employees, the press, and government officials informed about the situation and the company’s response to it.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-collins-fn06_009">Brian Perkins, “Defining Crisis Management,” <em class="emphasis">Wharton Alumni Magazine</em>, Summer 2000, <a class="link" href="http://www.wharton.upenn.edu/alum_mag/issues/summer2000/feature_3b.html">http://www.wharton.upenn.edu/alum_mag/issues/summer2000/feature_3b.html</a> (accessed May 3, 2006).</span></p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch06_s02_s07_s02_p02">An example of how to handle crisis management involves Wendy’s. After learning that a woman claimed she found a fingertip in a bowl of chili she bought at a Wendy’s restaurant in San Jose, California, the company’s public relations team responded quickly. Within a few days, the company announced that the finger didn’t come from an employee or a supplier. Soon after, the police arrested the woman and charged her with attempted grand larceny for lying about how the finger got in her bowl of chili and trying to extort $2.5 million from the company. But the crisis wasn’t over for Wendy’s. The incident was plastered all over the news as a grossed-out public sought an answer to the question, Whose finger is (or was) it? A $100,000 reward was offered by Wendy’s to anyone with information that would help the police answer this question. The challenge Wendy’s faced was how to entice customers to return to its fifty San Francisco–area restaurants (where sales had plummeted) while keeping a low profile nationally. It accomplished this by giving out free milkshakes and discount coupons to customers in the affected regions and, to avoid calling attention to the missing finger, by making no changes in its national advertising. The crisis-management strategy worked and the story died down (though it flared up temporarily when the police arrested the woman’s husband, who allegedly bought the finger from a coworker who had severed it in an accident months earlier).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-collins-fn06_010">Stewart Elliott, “Wendy’s Gets a Break, but Still Has Work Ahead of It,” <em class="emphasis">The New York Times</em>, April 29, 2005, <a class="link" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2005/04/29/business/media/29adco.html?ei=5088&amp;en=bb0e017145269f5e&amp;">http://www.nytimes.com/2005/04/29/business/media/29adco.html?ei=5088&amp;en=bb0e017145269f5e&amp;</a> (accessed May 4, 2006).</span></p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch06_s02_s07_s02_p03">Even with crisis-management plans in place, however, it’s unlikely that most companies will emerge from a damaging or potentially damaging episode as unscathed as Wendy’s did. For one thing, the culprits in the Wendy’s case were caught and the public is willing to forgive an organization it views as a victim. Given the current public distrust of corporate behavior, however, companies whose reputations have suffered due to questionable corporate judgment don’t fare as well. These companies include Firestone and Ford (both of which were responsible for faulty tire treads), Exxon (one of whose oil tankers ran aground and polluted Alaska’s Prince William Sound), and ValuJet (which wasn’t particularly forthcoming after a plane crash in the Everglades). Then, there are the companies at which executives have crossed the line between the unethical to the downright illegal—Arthur Andersen, Enron, Adelphia, ImClone, and Bernard L. Madoff Investment Securities, to name just a few. It should come as no surprise that contemporary managers spend more time anticipating crises and practicing their crisis-management responses.</p>

First, assume that you oversee a large company that manufactures and sells medical devices, such as pacemakers, defibrillators, and insulin pumps. Your company was a pioneer in bringing these products to the market. Identify six core values that you would want to guide the behavior of your employees.
