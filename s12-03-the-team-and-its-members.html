More than two-thirds of all students report having participated in the work of an organized team, and if you’re in business school, you will almost certainly find yourself engaged in team-based activities.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-collins-fn08_019">David A.

        <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch08_s03_s01_p03">Why do we put so much emphasis on something that, reportedly, makes many students feel anxious and academically drained? Here’s one college student’s practical-minded answer to this question:</p>
        <span class="blockquote block" id="collins-ch08_s03_s01_bl01">
            <p class="para editable" id="collins-ch08_s03_s01_p04">“In the real world, you have to work with people. You don’t always know the people you work with, and you don’t always get along with them. Your boss won’t particularly care, and if you can’t get the job done, your job may end up on the line. Life is all about group work, whether we like it or not. And school, in many ways, prepares us for life, including working with others.”<span class="footnote" id="fwk-collins-fn08_020">Hannah Nichols, “Teamwork in School, Work and Life,” <em class="emphasis">iamnext.com</em>, 2003, <a class="link" href="http://www.iamnext.com/academics/groupwork.html">http://www.iamnext.com/academics/groupwork.html</a> (accessed September 1, 2008).</span></p>
        </span>
        <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch08_s03_s01_p05">She’s right. In placing so much emphasis on teamwork skills and experience, college business departments are doing the responsible thing—preparing students for the business world that awaits them. A survey of <em class="emphasis">Fortune</em> 1000 companies reveals that 79 percent already rely on self-managing teams and 91 percent on various forms of employee work groups. Another survey found that the skill that most employers value in new employees is the ability to work in teams.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-collins-fn08_021">David A. Whetten and Kim S. Cameron, <em class="emphasis">Developing Management Skills</em>, 7th ed. (Upper Saddle River, NJ: Pearson Education, 2007), 498–99. See Edward E. Lawler, <em class="emphasis">Treat People Right</em> (San Francisco: Jossey-Bass, 2003).</span> If you’re already trying to work your way up an organizational ladder, consider the advice of former Chrysler Chairman Lee Iacocca: “A major reason that capable people fail to advance is that they don’t work well with their colleagues.”<span class="footnote" id="fwk-collins-fn08_022">Quoted by Terry L. Paulson, “Building Bridges vs. Burning Them: The Subtle Art of Influence,” 1990, at <a class="link" href="http://books.google.com/books?id=iXkq-IFFJpcC&amp;pg=PA55&amp;lpg=PA55&amp;dq=%22capable+people+fail+to+advance%22&amp;source=web&amp;ots=a2l2cJ2_AF&amp;sig=4Xk7EuOq2htSf2XqBWSFQxJwVqE&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ct=result">http://books.google.com/books?id=iXkq-IFFJpcC&amp;pg=PA55&amp;lpg=PA55&amp;dq=%22capable+people+fail+to+advance%22&amp;source=web&amp;ots=a2l2cJ2_AF&amp;sig=4Xk7EuOq2htSf2XqBWSFQxJwVqE&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ct=result</a> (accessed September 2, 2008).</span> The importance of the ability to work in teams was confirmed in a survey of leadership practices of more than sixty of the world’s top organizations.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-collins-fn08_023">“What Makes Great Leaders: Rethinking the Route to Effective Leadership,” Findings from the Fortune Magazine/Hay Group 1999 Executive Survey of Leadership Effectiveness, <a class="link" href="http://ei.haygroup.com/downloads/pdf/Leadership%20White%20Paper.pdf">http://ei.haygroup.com/downloads/pdf/Leadership%20White%20Paper.pdf</a> (accessed August 9, 2008).</span> When top executives in these organizations were asked, “What causes high-potential leadership candidates to derail? (stop moving up in the organization),” 60 percent of the organizations cited “inability to work in teams.” Interestingly, only 9 percent attributed the failure of these executives to advance to “lack of technical ability.” While technical skills will be essential in your getting hired into an organization, your team skills will play a significant role in your ability to advance.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch08_s03_s01_p06">To be team-ready or not to be team-ready—that is the question. Or, to put it in plainer terms, the question is not whether you’ll find yourself working as part of a team. You will. The question is whether you’ll know how to participate successfully in team-based activities.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Will <em class="emphasis">You</em> Make a Good Team Member?</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch08_s03_s02_p01">What if your instructor in this course decides to divide the class into several three-, four-, or five-member teams and assigns each team to develop a new product plus a business plan to get it into production and out on the market? What teamwork skills could you bring to the table? What teamwork skills do you need to work on? What qualities do you possess that might make you a good team leader?</p>
        <div class="section" id="collins-ch08_s03_s02_s01">
            <h2 class="title editable block">What Skills Does the Team Need?</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch08_s03_s02_s01_p01">Sometimes we hear about a sports team made up of mostly average players who win a championship because of coaching genius, flawless teamwork, and superhuman determination.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-collins-fn08_024">This section is based on Stephen P. Robbins and Timothy A. Judge, <em class="emphasis">Organizational Behavior</em>, 13th ed. (Upper Saddle River, NJ: Pearson Education, 2009), 346–47.</span> But not terribly often. In fact, we usually hear about such teams simply because they’re newsworthy—exceptions to the rule. Typically a team performs well because its members possess some level of talent. This doesn’t mean, however, that we should reduce team performance to the mere sum of its individual contributions: Members’ talents aren’t very useful if they’re not managed in a collective effort to achieve a common goal.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch08_s03_s02_s01_p02">In the final analysis, of course, a team can succeed only if its members provide the skills that need managing. In particular, every team requires some mixture of three sets of skills (notice, by the way, that these skill sets overlap considerably with the managerial skill sets that we discussed in <a class="xref" href="collins-ch06#collins-ch06">Chapter 6 "Managing for Business Success"</a>):</p>
            <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="collins-ch08_s03_s02_s01_l01">
                <li>
<em class="emphasis">Technical skills</em>. Because teams must perform certain tasks, they need people with the skills to perform them. For example, if your project calls for a lot of math work, it’s good to have someone with the necessary quantitative skills.</li>
                <li>
<em class="emphasis">Decision-making and problem-solving skills</em>. Because every task is subject to problems, and because handling every problem means deciding on the best solution, it’s good to have members who are skilled in identifying problems, evaluating alternative solutions, and deciding on the best options.</li>
                <li>
<em class="emphasis">Interpersonal skills</em>. Because teams are composed of people, and because people need direction and motivation and depend on communication, every group benefits from members who know how to listen, provide feedback, and smooth ruffled feathers. The same people are usually good at communicating the team’s goals and needs to outsiders.</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch08_s03_s02_s01_p03">The key to success is ultimately the right mix of these skills. Remember, too, that no team needs to possess all these skills—never mind the right balance of them—from day one. In many cases, a team gains certain skills only when members volunteer for certain tasks and perfect their skills in the process of performing them. For the same reason, effective teamwork develops over time as team members learn how to handle various team-based tasks. In a sense, teamwork is always work in progress.</p>

            <h2 class="title editable block">What Roles Do Team Members Play?</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch08_s03_s02_s02_p01">Like your teamwork skills, expect your role on a team to develop over time. Also remember that, both as a student and as a member of the workforce, you’ll be a <em class="emphasis">member</em> of a team more often than a <em class="emphasis">leader</em> (a subject that we’ll take up in the next section). Team members, however, can have as much impact on a team’s success as its leaders. The key is the quality of the contributions they make in performing nonleadership roles.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-collins-fn08_025">This section is based on David A. Whetten and Kim S. Cameron, <em class="emphasis">Developing Management Skills</em>, 7th ed. (Upper Saddle River, NJ: Pearson Education, 2007), 516–20.</span></p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch08_s03_s02_s02_p02">What, exactly, are those roles? At this point, you’ve probably concluded that every team faces two basic challenges:</p>
            <ol class="orderedlist editable block" id="collins-ch08_s03_s02_s02_l01">
                <li>Accomplishing its assigned task</li>
                <li>Maintaining or improving group cohesiveness</li>
            </ol>
            <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch08_s03_s02_s02_p03">Whether you affect the team’s work positively or negatively depends on the extent to which you help it or hinder it in meeting these two challenges.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-collins-fn08_026">David A. Whetten and Kim S. Cameron, <em class="emphasis">Developing Management Skills</em>, 7th ed. (Upper Saddle River, NJ: Pearson Education, 2007), 516–17.</span> We can thus divide teamwork roles into two categories, depending on which of these two challenges each role addresses. These two categories (task-facilitating roles and relationship-building roles) are summarized in <a class="xref" href="#collins-ch08_s03_s02_s02_t01">Table 8.2 "Roles That Team Members Play"</a>.</p>

In addition, it includes <em class="emphasis">monitoring</em> (checking on progress) and <em class="emphasis">enforcing</em> (making sure that team decisions are carried out). Task facilitators are especially valuable when assignments aren’t clear or when progress is too slow.

                <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch08_s03_s02_s02_s02_p02">Bear in mind three points about this model of team-membership roles: (1) Teams are most effective when there’s a good balance between task facilitation and relationship building; (2) it’s hard for any given member to perform both types of roles, as some people are better at focusing on tasks and others on relationships; and (3) overplaying any facet of any role can easily become counterproductive. For example, <em class="emphasis">elaborating</em> on something may not be the best strategy when the team needs to make a quick decision; and <em class="emphasis">consensus building</em> may cause the team to overlook an important difference of opinion.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Class Team Projects</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch08_s03_s03_p01">As we highlighted earlier, throughout your academic career you’ll likely participate in a number of team projects. Not only will you make lasting friends by being a member of a team, but in addition you’ll produce a better product. To get insider advice on how to survive team projects in college (and perhaps really enjoy yourself in the process), let’s look at some suggestions offered by two students who have gone through this experience.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-collins-fn08_027">Hannah Nichols, “Teamwork in School, Work and Life,” iamnext.com 2003,<a class="link" href="http://www.iamnext.com/academics/groupwork.html">http://www.iamnext.com/academics/groupwork.html</a> (accessed August 10, 2008); and Kristin Feenstra, “Study Skills: Team Work Skills for Group Projects,” <em class="emphasis">iamnext.com</em>, 2002, <a class="link" href="http://www.iamnext.com/academics/grouproject.html">http://www.iamnext.com/academics/grouproject.html</a> (accessed August 20, 2008).</span></p>
        <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="collins-ch08_s03_s03_l01">
            <li>
<em class="emphasis">Draw up a team charter</em>. At the beginning of the project, draw up a team charter (or contract) that includes the goals of the group; ways to ensure that each team member’s ideas are considered and respected; when and where your group will meet; what happens if a team member skips meetings or doesn’t do his or her share of the work; how conflicts will be resolved.</li>
            <li>
<em class="emphasis">Contribute your ideas</em>. Share your ideas with your group; they might be valuable to the group. The worst that could happen is that they won’t be used (which is what would happen if you kept quiet).</li>
            <li>
<em class="emphasis">Never miss a meeting</em>. Pick a weekly meeting time and write it into your schedule as if it were a class. Never skip it. And make your meetings productive.</li>
            <li>
<em class="emphasis">Be considerate of each other</em>. Be patient, listen to everyone, communicate frequently, involve everyone in decision making, don’t think you’re always right, be positive, avoid infighting, build trust.</li>
            <li>
<em class="emphasis">Create a process for resolving conflict</em>. Do this before conflict arises. Set up rules to help the group decide whether the conflict is constructive, whether it’s personal, or whether it arises because someone won’t pull his or her weight. Decide, as a group, how conflict will be handled.</li>
            <li>
<em class="emphasis">Use the strengths of each team member</em>. Some students are good researchers, others are good writers, others have strong problem-solving or computer skills, while others are good at generating ideas. Don’t have your writer do the research and your researcher do the writing. Not only would the team not be using its resources wisely, but two team members will be frustrated because they’re not using their strengths.</li>
            <li>
<em class="emphasis">Don’t do all the work yourself</em>. Work with your team to get the work done. The project output is not as important as the experience of working in a team.</li>
            <li>
<em class="emphasis">Set deadlines</em>. Don’t leave everything to the end; divide up tasks, hold team members accountable, and set intermediary deadlines for each team member to get his or her work done. Work together to be sure the project is in on time and in good shape.</li>

        <h2 class="title editable block">What Does It Take to Lead a Team?</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch08_s03_s04_p01">“Some people are born leaders, some achieve leadership, and some have leadership thrust upon them.” Or so Shakespeare might have said if he were managing a twenty-first-century work team instead of a sixteenth-century theater troupe. At some point in a successful career, whether in business, school, or any other form of organizational work, you may be asked (or assigned) to lead a team. The more successful you are, the more likely you are to receive such an invitation. So, what will you have to do as a leader? What skills will you need?</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch08_s03_s04_p02">Like so many of the questions that we ask in this book, these questions don’t have any simple answers. As for the first question—What does a leader have to do?—we can provide one broad answer: A leader must help members develop the attitudes and behavior that contribute to team success: interdependence, collective responsibility, shared commitment, and so forth.</p>

            <h2 class="title editable block">Influence Team Members and Gain their Trust</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch08_s03_s04_s01_p01">Team leaders must be able to influence their team members. And notice that we say <em class="emphasis">influence</em>: except in unusual circumstances, giving commands and controlling everything directly doesn’t work very well.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-collins-fn08_028">This section is based on David A. Whetten and Kim S. Cameron, <em class="emphasis">Developing Management Skills</em>, 7th ed. (Upper Saddle River, NJ: Pearson Education, 2007), 510–13.</span> As one team of researchers puts it, team leaders are more effective when they work <em class="emphasis">with</em> members rather than <em class="emphasis">on</em> them.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-collins-fn08_029">David A. Whetten and Kim S. Cameron, <em class="emphasis">Developing Management Skills</em>, 7th ed. (Upper Saddle River, NJ: Pearson Education, 2007), 511.</span> Hand in hand with the ability to influence is the ability to gain and keep the <em class="emphasis">trust</em> of team members. People aren’t likely to be influenced by a leader whom they perceive as dishonest or selfishly motivated.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch08_s03_s04_s01_p02">Assuming you were asked to lead a team, there are certain leadership skills and behaviors that would help you influence your team members and build trust. Let’s look at seven of these:</p>
            <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="collins-ch08_s03_s04_s01_l01">
                <li>
<em class="emphasis">Demonstrate integrity</em>. Do what you say you’ll do, and act in accordance with your stated values. Be honest in communicating with members, and follow through on promises.</li>
                <li>
<em class="emphasis">Be clear and consistent</em>. Let members know that you’re certain about what you want, and remember that being clear and consistent reinforces your credibility.</li>
                <li>
<em class="emphasis">Generate positive energy</em>. Be optimistic and compliment team members. Recognize their progress and success.</li>
                <li>
<em class="emphasis">Acknowledge common points of view</em>. Even if you’re about to propose some kind of change, before embarking on a new stage of a project recognize the value of the views that members already hold in common.</li>
                <li>
<em class="emphasis">Manage agreement and disagreement</em>. When members agree with you, focus on your point of view and present it reasonably. When they disagree with you, acknowledge both sides of the issue and support your own with strong, clearly presented evidence.</li>
                <li>
<em class="emphasis">Encourage and coach</em>. Buoy up members when they run into new and uncertain situations and when success depends on their performing at a high level. Give them the information they need and otherwise help them to perform tasks.</li>
                <li>
<em class="emphasis">Share information</em>. Let members know that you’re knowledgeable about team tasks and individual talents. Check with team members regularly to find out what they’re doing and how the job is progressing. Collect information from outside sources, and make sure that it gets to the team members who need it.</li>
