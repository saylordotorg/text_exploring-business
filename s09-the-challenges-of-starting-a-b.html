Rick, a father of two young children, remarked that trundling around a sack of flour wasn’t exactly a true-to-life experience. In particular, he argued, sacks of flour simulated only abnormally happy babies—babies who didn’t cry, especially in the middle of the night. Half-seriously, Mary suggested that her husband—a between-jobs aerospace engineer—build a better baby, and within a couple of weeks, a prototype was born. Rick’s brainchild was a bouncing 6.5-pound bundle of vinyl-covered joy with an internal computer to simulate infant crying at realistic, random intervals. He also designed a drug-affected model to simulate tremors from withdrawal, and each model monitored itself for neglect or ill treatment.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch05_s00_p02">The Jurmains patented Baby Think It Over (aka BTIO) and started production in 1994 as Baby Think It Over Inc. Their first “factory” was their garage, and the “office” was the kitchen table—“a little business in a house,” as Mary put it. With a boost from articles in <em class="emphasis">USA Today</em>, <em class="emphasis">Newsweek</em>, <em class="emphasis">Forbes</em>, and <em class="emphasis">People</em>—plus a “Product of the Year” nod from <em class="emphasis">Fortune</em>—news of the Jurmains’ “infant simulator” eventually spread to the new company’s targeted education market, and by 1998, some forty thousand simulators had been babysat by more than a million teenagers in nine countries. By that time, the company had moved to Wisconsin, where it had been rechristened BTIO Educational Products Inc. to reflect an expanded product line that now includes not only dolls and equipment, like the Shaken Baby Syndrome Simulator, but also simulator-based programs like ySTART Addiction Education and Realityworks Pregnancy Profile. BTIO was retired and replaced by the new and improved RealCare Baby and, ultimately, by RealCare Baby II–<em class="emphasis">plus</em>, which requires the participant to determine what the “baby” needs when it cries and downloads data to record mishaps (such as missed-care events) and misconduct (like baby shaking). If RealCare Baby II–<em class="emphasis">plus</em> shows signs of fatigue, you can plug him or her into the nearest wall outlet. In 2003, the name of the Jurmains’ company was changed once again, this time to Realityworks Inc. The change, explains the company Web site, reflects its decision “to focus on what the company does best—providing realistic learning experiences.”</p>

    <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch05_s01_p01">In developing BTIO and Realityworks Inc., the Jurmains were doing what entrepreneurs do (and doing it very well). In fact, Mary was nominated three times for the Ernst &amp; Young Entrepreneur of the Year Award and named 2001 Wisconsin Entrepreneurial Woman of the Year by the National Association of Women Business Owners. So what, exactly, is an <em class="emphasis">entrepreneur</em>? What does an entrepreneur do? According to one definition, an entrepreneur is an “individual who starts a new business,” and that’s true as far as it goes. Another definition identifies an entrepreneur as someone who uses “resources to implement innovative ideas for new, thoughtfully planned ventures”<span class="footnote" id="fwk-collins-fn05_002">Canadian Foundation for Economic Education, “Glossary of Terms,” <em class="emphasis">Mentors, Ventures &amp; Plans</em> (2008), <a class="link" href="http://www.mvp.cfee.org/en/glossary.html">http://www.mvp.cfee.org/en/glossary.html</a> (accessed October 7, 2008).</span> which is also true as far as it goes. But an important component of a satisfactory definition is still missing. To appreciate fully what it is, let’s go back to the story of the Jurmains, for whom entrepreneurship seems to have worked out quite well. We hasten to point out that, in 1993, the Jurmains were both unemployed—Rick had been laid off by General Dynamics Corp., and Mary by the San Diego Gas and Electric Company. While they were watching the show about teenagers and flour sacks, they were living off a loan from her father and the returns from a timely investment in coffee futures. Rick recalls that the idea for a method of creating BTIO came to him while “I was awake in bed, worrying about being unemployed.” He was struggling to find a way to feed his family. He had to make the first forty simulators himself, and at the end of the first summer, BTIO had received about four hundred orders—a promising start, perhaps, but, at $250 per baby (less expenses), not exactly a windfall. “We were always about one month away from bankruptcy,” recalls Mary.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch05_s01_p02">At the same time, it’s not as if the Jurmains started up BTIO simply because they had no “conventional” options for improving their financial prospects. Rick, as we’ve seen, was an aerospace engineer, and his résumé includes work on space-shuttle missions at NASA. Mary, who has not only a head for business but also a degree in industrial engineering, has worked at the Johnson Space Center. Therefore, the idea of replacing a sack of flour with a computer-controlled simulator wasn’t necessarily rocket science for the couple. But taking advantage of that idea—choosing to start a new business and to commit themselves to running it—was a risk. <em class="emphasis">Risk taking</em> is the missing component that we’re looking for in a definition of <em class="emphasis">entrepreneurship</em>, and so we’ll define an <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">entrepreneur</a><span class="glossdef">Individual who identifies a business opportunity and assumes the risk of creating and running a business to take advantage of it.</span></span> as someone who identifies a business opportunity and assumes <em class="emphasis">the risk of creating and running a business</em> to take advantage of it.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">The Nature of Entrepreneurship</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch05_s01_s01_p01">If we look a little more closely at the definition of entrepreneurship, we can identify three characteristics of entrepreneurial activity:<span class="footnote" id="fwk-collins-fn05_003">Adapted from Marc J. Dollinger, <em class="emphasis">Entrepreneurship</em>: <em class="emphasis">Strategies and Resources</em>, 3rd ed. (Upper Saddle River, NJ: Prentice Hall, 2003), 5–7.</span></p>
        <ol class="orderedlist editable block" id="collins-ch05_s01_s01_l01">
            <li>
<em class="emphasis">Innovation</em>. Entrepreneurship generally means offering a new product, applying a new technique or technology, opening a new market, or developing a new form of organization for the purpose of producing or enhancing a product.</li>
            <li>
<em class="emphasis">Running a business</em>. A <em class="emphasis">business</em>, as we saw in <a class="xref" href="collins-ch01#collins-ch01">Chapter 1 "The Foundations of Business"</a>, combines resources to produce goods or services. Entrepreneurship means setting up a business to make a profit.</li>
            <li>
<em class="emphasis">Risk taking</em>. The term <em class="emphasis">risk</em> means that the outcome of the entrepreneurial venture can’t be known. Entrepreneurs, therefore, are always working under a certain degree of <em class="emphasis">uncertainty</em>, and they can’t know the outcomes of many of the decisions that they have to make. Consequently, many of the steps they take are motivated mainly by their confidence in the innovation and in their understanding of the business environment in which they’re operating.</li>
        </ol>
        <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch05_s01_s01_p02">It isn’t hard to recognize all three of these characteristics in the entrepreneurial experience of the Jurmains. They certainly had an <em class="emphasis">innovative</em> idea. But was it a <em class="emphasis">good</em> business idea? In a practical sense, a “good” business idea has to become something more than just an idea. If, like the Jurmains, you’re interested in generating income from your idea, you’ll probably need to turn it into a <em class="emphasis">product</em>—something that you can market because it satisfies a need. If—again, like the Jurmains—you want to develop a product, you’ll need some kind of organization to coordinate the resources necessary to make it a reality (in other words, a <em class="emphasis">business</em>). Risk enters the equation when, like the Jurmains, you make the decision to start up a business and when you commit yourself to managing it.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch05_s02_s02_p01">Small business constitutes a major force in the U.S. economy. There are nearly twenty-seven million small businesses in this country, and they generate about 50 percent of our gross domestic product (GDP).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-collins-fn05_012">Office of Advocacy, U.S. Small Business Administration, <em class="emphasis">The Small Business Economy for Data Year 2006: A Report to the President</em> (December 2007), <a class="link" href="http://www.sba.gov/advo/research/sb_econ2007.pdf">http://www.sba.gov/advo/research/sb_econ2007.pdf</a> (accessed October 9, 2008).</span> Indeed, if all the small businesses in the United States seceded and formed their own economy, it would be the third-largest economy in the world (behind the United States itself and China).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-collins-fn05_013">Thomas W. Zimmerer and Norman M. Scarborough, <em class="emphasis">Essentials of Entrepreneurship and Small Business Management</em>, 5th ed. (Upper Saddle River, NJ: Pearson Education, 2008), 27.</span> The millions of individuals who have started businesses in the United States have shaped the business world as we know it today. Some small business founders like Henry Ford and Thomas Edison have even gained places in history. Others, including Bill Gates (Microsoft), Sam Walton (Wal-Mart), Steve Jobs (Apple Computer), Michael Dell (Dell, Inc.), Steve Case (AOL), Pierre Omidyar (eBay), and Larry Page and Sergey Brin (Google), have changed the way business is done today. Still millions of others have collectively contributed to our standard of living.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch05_s02_s02_p02">Aside from contributions to our general economic well-being, founders of small businesses also contribute to growth and vitality in specific areas of economic and socioeconomic development. In particular, small businesses do the following:</p>
        <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="collins-ch05_s02_s02_l01">
            <li>Create jobs</li>

        <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch05_s02_s02_p03">In addition, they complement the economic activity of large organizations by providing them with components, services, and distribution of their products.</p>

In the decade between 1995 and 2005, small businesses also created 60 percent to 80 percent of net new jobs annually, including 40 percent of high-tech workers (scientists, engineers, computer workers). Their share of total employment remains steady at about 51 percent, because many small firms, as they add employees, naturally grow into large firms.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-collins-fn05_015">Terry Bibbens, “A New View of Government, University, and Industry Partnerships” (U.S. Small Business Administration, Office of Advocacy, February 2000), 2, <a class="link" href="http://www.sba.gov/advo/laws/test99_0804.pdf">http://www.sba.gov/advo/laws/test99_0804.pdf</a> (accessed October 10, 2008), 3.</span></p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch05_s02_s02_s02_p01">Given the financial resources available to large businesses, you’d expect them to introduce virtually all the new products that hit the market. According to the SBA, however, 40 percent of all U.S. corporate patents come from small businesses, self-employed inventors, and inventors working for small companies.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-collins-fn05_016">CHI Research Inc., “Small Serial Innovators: The Small Firm Contribution to Technical Change” (U.S. Small Business Administration, Office of Advocacy, March 2003), 11, <a class="link" href="http://www.sba.gov/advo/research/rs225tot.pdf">http://www.sba.gov/advo/research/rs225tot.pdf</a> (accessed October 10, 2008).</span> Over the years, the list of important innovations by small firms has included the airplane and air-conditioning, the defibrillator and DNA fingerprinting, oral contraceptives and overnight national delivery, the safety razor, strobe lights, and the zipper.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-collins-fn05_017">William J.

            <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch05_s02_s02_s02_p02">Small business owners are also particularly adept at finding new ways of doing old things. In 1994, for example, a young computer-science graduate working on Wall Street came up with the novel idea of selling books over the Internet. During the first year of operations, sales at Jeff Bezos’s new company—Amazon.com—reached half a million dollars. In less than ten years, annual sales had topped $3 billion. Not only did his innovative approach to online retailing make Bezos enormously rich, but it also established a viable model for the e-commerce industry.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch05_s02_s02_s02_p03">Why are small businesses so innovative? For one thing, they tend to offer environments that appeal to individuals with the talent to invent new products or improve the way things are done. Fast decision making is encouraged, their research programs tend to be focused, and their compensation structures typically reward top performers. According to one SBA study, the supportive environments of small firms are roughly thirteen times more innovative per employee than the less innovation-friendly environments in which large firms traditionally operate.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-collins-fn05_018">William J. Baumol, “Small Firms: Why Market-Driven Innovation Can’t Get Along without Them” (U.S. Small Business Administration, Office of Advocacy, December 2005), <a class="link" href="http://www.sba.gov/advo/research/sbe_05_ch08.pdf">http://www.sba.gov/advo/research/sbe_05_ch08.pdf</a> (accessed October 10, 2008), 187.</span></p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch05_s02_s02_s02_p04">The success of small businesses in fostering creativity has not gone unnoticed by big businesses. In fact, many large companies have responded by downsizing to act more like small companies. Some large organizations now have separate work units whose purpose is to spark innovation. Individuals working in these units can focus their attention on creating new products that can then be developed by the company.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch05_s02_s02_s04_p01">Small firms complement large firms in a number of ways. They supply many of the components needed by big companies. For example, a substantial portion of the mind-boggling $90 billion paid annually by General Motors to parts suppliers goes to small businesses. Small firms also provide large ones with such services as accounting, legal, and insurance. Many small firms provide <em class="emphasis">outsourcing</em> services to large firms—that is, they hire themselves out to help with special projects or handle certain business functions. A large firm, for example, might hire a small one to handle its billing or collection services or to manage its health care benefits. A large company might contract with a small information technology firm to manage its Web site or oversee software upgrades.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch05_s02_s02_s04_p02">Small companies provide another valuable service to large companies by acting as sales agents for their products. For example, automobile dealerships, which are generally small businesses, sell vehicles for the big car makers. Local sporting goods stores sell athletic shoes made by industry giants, such as Adidas and Nike. Your corner deli sells products made by large companies, such as Coca-Cola and Frito-Lay.</p>

                        <p class="para">The nearly twenty-seven million small businesses in the United States generate about 50 percent of our GDP.

                    <li>Small businesses tend to foster environments that appeal to individuals with the talent to invent new products or improve the way things are done.

They also provide large firms with such services as accounting, legal, and insurance, and many provide <em class="emphasis">outsourcing</em> services to large companies—that is, they hire themselves out to help with special projects or handle certain business functions. Small companies (such as automotive dealerships) often act as sales agents for the products of large businesses (for example, car makers).</li>

    <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch05_s03_p01">If you want to start a new business, you probably should avoid certain types of businesses. You’d have a hard time, for example, setting up a new company to make automobiles or aluminum, because you’d have to make tremendous investments in property, plant, and equipment, and raise an enormous amount of capital to pay your workforce.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch05_s03_p02">Fortunately, plenty of opportunities are still available if you’re willing to set your sights a little lower. Many types of businesses require reasonable initial investments, and not surprisingly, these are the ones that usually present attractive small business opportunities.</p>
    <div class="section" id="collins-ch05_s03_s01">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Industries by Sector</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch05_s03_s01_p01">We’ll have more to say about industries and how to analyze them in later chapters. Here, we’ll simply define an <em class="emphasis">industry</em> as a group of companies that compete with one another to sell similar products, and we’ll focus on the relationship between a small business and the industry in which it operates. First, we’ll discuss the industries in which small businesses tend to be concentrated. To do this, we’ll divide businesses into two broad types of industries, or sectors: the goods-producing sector and the service-producing sector.</p>
        <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="collins-ch05_s03_s01_l01">
            <li>The <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">goods-producing sector</a><span class="glossdef">All businesses whose primary purpose is to produce tangible goods.</span></span> includes all businesses that produce tangible goods. Generally speaking, companies in this sector are involved in manufacturing, construction, and agriculture.</li>
            <li>The <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">service-producing sector</a><span class="glossdef">All businesses whose primary purpose is to provide a service rather than make tangible goods.</span></span> includes all businesses that provide services but don’t make tangible goods. They may be involved in retail and wholesale trade, transportation, communications, finance, insurance, real estate, and such professional activities as health care, advertising, accounting, and personal services.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch05_s03_s01_p02">About 80 percent of small businesses in the United States are concentrated in the service-producing sector. Of these, about 25 percent are in retailing, 10 percent in wholesaling, and 35 percent in professional and business services. Of the 20 percent of all small businesses in the goods-producing sector, nearly two thirds are in construction and the other one third in manufacturing.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-collins-fn05_020">John Case, “What Businesses Are Small Companies Really In—And Where Are They Scarce,” <em class="emphasis">Inc.com</em> (May 2001), <a class="link" href="http://www.inc.com/magazine/20010515/22612.html">http://www.inc.com/magazine/20010515/22612.html</a> (accessed October 11, 2008) (October 11, 2008).</span></p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch05_s03_s01_p03">The high concentration of small businesses in the service-producing sector reflects the makeup of the overall U.S. economy. Over the past forty years, the service-producing sector has been growing at an impressive rate. In 1960, for example, the goods-producing sector accounted for 38 percent of GDP, the service-producing sector for 62 percent. By 2000, the balance had shifted dramatically, with the goods-producing sector accounting for only 23 percent of GDP, while the service-producing sector had grown to 77 percent.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-collins-fn05_021">Laura Baughman, “Why Congress Should Fund Better Services Data,” <em class="emphasis">Sitrends.org</em> (May 6, 2002), <a class="link" href="http://www.sitrends.org/ideas/expert.asp?EXPERT_ID=49">http://www.sitrends.org/ideas/expert.asp?EXPERT_ID=49</a> (accessed October 11, 2008) (October 11, 2008).</span></p>
        <div class="section" id="collins-ch05_s03_s01_s01">
            <h2 class="title editable block">Goods-Producing Sector</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch05_s03_s01_s01_p01">The largest areas of the goods-producing sector are construction and manufacturing. Construction businesses are often started by skilled workers, such as electricians, painters, plumbers, and home builders. They tend to be small and generally work on local projects. Though manufacturing is primarily the domain of large businesses, there are exceptions. BTIO/Realityworks, for example, is a manufacturing enterprise (components come from Ohio and China, and assembly is done in Wisconsin).</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch05_s03_s01_s01_p02">Another small manufacturer is Reveal Entertainment, which was founded in 1996 to make and distribute board games. Founder Jeffrey Berndt started with a single award-winning game—a three-dimensional finance and real estate game called “Tripoly”—and now boasts a product line of dozens of board games. There are strategy games, like “Squad Seven,” which uses a CD soundtrack to guide players through a jungle in search of treasure; children’s games, like “Portfolio Junior,” which teaches kids the rudiments of personal finances; and party games, like “So Sue Me,” in which players get to experience the fun side of suing their neighbors and taking their possessions.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-collins-fn05_022">Go to Reveal Entertainment at <a class="link" href="http://www.revealgames.com">http://www.revealgames.com</a> (accessed October 11, 2008) (October 11, 2008).</span></p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch05_s03_s01_s02_p01">Many small businesses in this sector are <em class="emphasis">retailers</em>—they buy goods from other firms and sell them to consumers, in stores, by phone, through direct mailings, or over the Internet. In fact, entrepreneurs are turning increasingly to the Internet as a venue for start-up ventures. Take Tony Roeder, for example, who had a fascination with the red Radio Flyer wagons that many of today’s adults had owned as children. In 1998, he started an online store through Yahoo! to sell red wagons from his home. In three years, he turned his online store into a million-dollar business. Internet entrepreneurship was also attractive to Sean Lundgren and Todd Livdahl—two computer engineers who gave up successful careers at Disney to turn their fascination with video games and DVDs into an online business. To their delight, their small start-up venture, a CD and DVD retailer that they call Sneetch.com, generated sales of $1.2 million during its first year of operation.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-collins-fn05_023">Isabel Isidro, “What Works on the Web: 12 Lessons from Successful Home-Based Online Entrepreneurs,” <em class="emphasis">PowerHomeBiz.com</em> (2008), <a class="link" href="http://www.powerhomebiz.com/vol63/whatworks.htm">http://www.powerhomebiz.com/vol63/whatworks.htm</a> (accessed October 12, 2008) (October 12, 2008).</span></p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch05_s03_s01_s02_p02">Other small business owners in this sector are wholesalers—they sell products to businesses that buy them for resale or for company use. A local bakery, for example, is acting as a wholesaler when it sells desserts to a restaurant, which then resells them to its customers. A small business that buys flowers from a local grower (the manufacturer) and resells them to a retail store is another example of a wholesaler.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch05_s03_s01_s02_p03">A high proportion of small businesses in this sector provide professional, business, or personal services. Doctors and dentists are part of the service industry, as are insurance agents, accountants, and lawyers. So are businesses that provide personal services, such as dry cleaning and hairdressing.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch05_s03_s01_s02_p04">David Marcks, for example, entered the service industry about fourteen years ago when he learned that his border collie enjoyed chasing geese at the golf course where he worked. Anyone who’s been on a golf course recently knows exactly what the goose problem is. While they are lovely to look at, they answer the call of nature on tees, fairways, and greens. That’s where Marcks’s company, Geese Police, comes in: Marcks employs specially trained dogs to chase the geese away. He now has twenty-seven trucks, thirty-two border collies, and five offices. Golf courses account for only about 5 percent of his business, as his dogs now patrol corporate parks and playgrounds as well.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-collins-fn05_024">Isabel M.

        <h2 class="title editable block">Advantages of Small Business Ownership</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch05_s04_s01_p01">Being a business owner can be extremely rewarding. Having the courage to take a risk and start a venture is part of the American dream. Success brings with it many advantages:</p>
        <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="collins-ch05_s04_s01_l01">
            <li>
<em class="emphasis">Independence</em>. As a business owner, you’re your own boss. You can’t get fired. More importantly, you have the freedom to make the decisions that are crucial to your own business success.</li>
            <li>
<em class="emphasis">Lifestyle</em>. Owning a small business gives you certain lifestyle advantages. Because you’re in charge, you decide when and where you want to work. If you want to spend more time on nonwork activities or with your family, you don’t have to ask for the time off. If it’s important that you be with your family all day, you might decide to run your business from your home. Given today’s technology, it’s relatively easy to do. Moreover, it eliminates commuting time.</li>
            <li>
<em class="emphasis">Financial rewards</em>. In spite of high financial risk, running your own business gives you a chance to make more money than if you were employed by someone else. You benefit from your own hard work.</li>
            <li>
<em class="emphasis">Learning opportunities</em>. As a business owner, you’ll be involved in all aspects of your business. This situation creates numerous opportunities to gain a thorough understanding of the various business functions.</li>
            <li>
<em class="emphasis">Creative freedom and personal satisfaction</em>. As a business owner, you’ll be able to work in a field that you really enjoy. You’ll be able to put your skills and knowledge to use, and you’ll gain personal satisfaction from implementing your ideas, working directly with customers, and watching your business succeed.</li>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Disadvantages of Small Business Ownership</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch05_s04_s02_p01">As the little boy said when he got off his first roller-coaster ride, “I like the ups but not the downs!” Here are some of the risks you run if you want to start a small business:</p>
        <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="collins-ch05_s04_s02_l01">
            <li>
<em class="emphasis">Financial risk</em>. The financial resources needed to start and grow a business can be extensive. You may need to commit most of your savings or even go into debt to get started. If things don’t go well, you may face substantial financial loss. In addition, there’s no guaranteed income. There might be times, especially in the first few years, when the business isn’t generating enough cash for you to live on.</li>
            <li>
<em class="emphasis">Stress</em>. As a business owner, you <em class="emphasis">are</em> the business. There’s a bewildering array of things to worry about—competition, employees, bills, equipment breakdowns, customer problems. As the owner, you’re also responsible for the well-being of your employees.</li>
            <li>
<em class="emphasis">Time commitment</em>. People often start businesses so that they’ll have more time to spend with their families. Unfortunately, running a business is extremely time-consuming. In theory, you have the freedom to take time off, but in reality, you may not be able to get away. In fact, you’ll probably have less free time than you’d have working for someone else. For many entrepreneurs and small business owners, a forty-hour workweek is a myth; see <a class="xref" href="#collins-ch05_s04_s02_f01">Figure 5.7 "The Entrepreneur’s Workweek"</a>. Vacations will be difficult to take and will often be interrupted. In recent years, the difficulty of getting away from the job has been compounded by cell phones, WiFi laptops, and personal digital assistants (PDAs), and many small business owners have come to regret that they’re always reachable.</li>
            <li>
<em class="emphasis">Undesirable duties</em>. When you start up, you’ll undoubtedly be responsible for either doing or overseeing just about everything that needs to be done. You can get bogged down in detail work that you don’t enjoy. As a business owner, you’ll probably have to perform some unpleasant tasks, like firing people.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch05_s04_s02_p02">In spite of these and other disadvantages, most small business owners are pleased with their decision to start a business. A survey conducted by the <em class="emphasis">Wall Street Journal</em> and Cicco and Associates indicates that small business owners and top-level corporate executives agree overwhelmingly that small business owners have a more satisfying business experience. Interestingly, the researchers had fully expected to find that small business owners were happy with their choices; they were, however, surprised at the number of corporate executives who believed that the grass was greener in the world of small business ownership.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-collins-fn05_026">Cicco and Associates Inc., “Type E Personality—Happy Days—Entrepreneurs Top Satisfaction Survey,” <em class="emphasis">Entrepreneur.com</em>, <a class="link" href="http://entrepreneur-online.com/mag/article/0,1539,226838%E2%80%93-3-,00.html">http://entrepreneur-online.com/mag/article/0,1539,226838–-3-,00.html</a> (accessed April 21, 2006).</span></p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Questions to Ask Before You Start a Business</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch05_s05_s01_p01">If you’re interested in starting a business, you need to make decisions even before you bring your talent, determination, hard work, and persistence to bear on your project. Here are the basic questions you’ll need to address:</p>
        <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="collins-ch05_s05_s01_l01">
            <li>What, exactly, is my business idea? Is it feasible?</li>
            <li>What type of business is right for me? What industry do I want to get into? Do I want to be a manufacturer, a retailer, or a wholesaler? Do I want to provide professional or personal services? Do I want to start a business that I can operate out of my home?</li>
            <li>Do I want to run a business that’s similar to many existing businesses? Do I want to innovate—to create a new product or a new approach to doing business?</li>
            <li>Do I want to start a new business, buy an existing one, or buy a franchise?</li>
            <li>Do I want to start the business by myself or with others?</li>
            <li>What form of business organization do I want? Do I want to own the business myself, or do I want to work with other owners—say, as a partnership or a corporation?</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch05_s05_s01_p02">After making these decisions, you’ll be ready to take the most important step in the entire process of starting a business: you must describe your future business in the form of a <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">business plan</a><span class="glossdef">Formal document describing a proposed business concept, description of the proposed business, industry analysis, mission statement and core values, a management plan, a description of goods or services, a description of production processes, and marketing and financial plans.</span></span>—a document that identifies the goals of your proposed business and explains how these goals will be achieved. Think of a business plan as a blueprint for a proposed company: it shows how you intend to build the company and how you intend to make sure that it’s sturdy. You must also take a second crucial step before you actually start up your business: You need to get financing—the money from individuals, banks, or both, that you’ll need to get your business off the ground. (Obviously, if you already have the necessary funds, you’re one of the fortunate few who can skip this step.)</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">The Business Idea</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch05_s05_s02_p01">For some people, coming up with a great business idea is a gratifying adventure. For most, however, it’s a daunting task. The key to coming up with a business idea is identifying something that customers want—or, perhaps more importantly, filling an unmet need. Your business will probably survive only if its purpose is to <em class="emphasis">satisfy its customers</em>—the ultimate users of its goods or services. In coming up with a business idea, don’t ask, “What do we want to sell?” but rather, “What does the customer want to buy?”<span class="footnote" id="fwk-collins-fn05_028">Scott Thurm and Joann S. Lublin, “Peter Drucker’s Legacy Includes Simple Advice: It’s All about the People,” <em class="emphasis">Wall Street Journal</em> (November 14, 2005, B1), <a class="link" href="http://online.wsj.com/public/article/SB113192826302796041.html?mod=2_1194_3">http://online.wsj.com/public/article/SB113192826302796041.html?mod=2_1194_3</a> (accessed April 21, 2006).</span></p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch05_s05_s02_p02">To come up with an innovative business idea, you need to be creative. The idea itself can come from various sources. Prior experience accounts for the bulk of new business ideas. Many people generate ideas for industries they’re already working in. Past experience in an industry also increases your chances of success. Take Sam Walton, the late founder of Wal-Mart. He began his retailing career at JCPenney and then became a successful franchiser of a Ben Franklin five-and-dime store. In 1962, he came up with the idea of opening large stores in rural areas, with low costs and heavy discounts. He founded his first Wal-Mart store in 1962, and when he died thirty years later, his family’s net worth was $25 billion.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-collins-fn05_029">Peter Krass, “Sam Walton: 10 Rules for Building a Successful Business,” <a class="link" href="http://www.powerhomebiz.com/vol76/walton.htm">http://www.powerhomebiz.com/vol76/walton.htm</a> (accessed April 21, 2006).</span></p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch05_s05_s02_p03">Industry experience also gave Howard Schultz, a New York executive for a housewares company, his breakthrough idea. In 1981, Schultz noticed that a small customer in Seattle—Starbucks Coffee, Tea and Spice—ordered more coffeemaker cone filters than Macy’s and many other large customers. So he flew across the country to find out why. His meeting with the owner-operators of the original Starbucks Coffee Co. resulted in his becoming part-owner of the company, and changed his life and the life of coffee lovers forever. Schultz’s vision for the company far surpassed that of its other owners. While they wanted Starbucks to remain small and local, Schultz saw potential for a national business that not only sold world-class-quality coffee beans but also offered customers a European coffee-bar experience. After attempting unsuccessfully to convince his partners to try his experiment, Schultz left Starbucks and started his own chain of coffee bars, which he called Il Giornale (after an Italian newspaper). Two years later, he bought out the original owners and reclaimed the name Starbucks.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-collins-fn05_030">Howard Schultz and Dori Jones Yang, <em class="emphasis">Pour Your Heart into It</em> (New York: Hyperion, 1997), 24–109.</span></p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch05_s05_s02_p04">Other people come up with business ideas because of hobbies or personal interests. This was the case with Nike founder Phil Knight, who was an avid runner. He was convinced that it was possible to make high-quality track shoes that cost less than the European shoes dominating the market at the time. His track experience, coupled with his knowledge of business (Knight holds an MBA from Stanford and worked as an accountant), inspired him to start Nike. Michael Dell also turned a personal interest into a business. From a young age, he was obsessed with taking computers apart and putting them back together again, and it was this personal interest that led to his great business idea. At college, instead of attending classes, he spent his time assembling computers and, eventually, founded Dell Computers.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Ownership Options</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch05_s05_s03_p01">As we’ve already seen, you can become a small business owner in one of three ways—by starting a new business, buying an existing one, or obtaining a franchise. Let’s look more closely at the advantages and disadvantages of each option.</p>
        <div class="section" id="collins-ch05_s05_s03_s01">
            <h2 class="title editable block">Starting from Scratch</h2>

            <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch05_s05_s03_s01_p01">The most common—and the riskiest—option is starting from scratch. This approach lets you start with a clean slate and allows you to build the business the way you want. You select the goods or services that you’re going to offer, secure your location, and hire your employees, and then it’s up to you to develop your customer base and build your reputation. This is the path taken by Dean Kamen when he formed a company to design and market the Segway, and also by Tom Anderson and Chris DeWolfe when they started MySpace. Of course, for every Kamen, Anderson, and DeWolfe, there are hundreds of individuals whose venture into business was unsuccessful.</p>

        <div class="section" id="collins-ch05_s05_s03_s02">
            <h2 class="title editable block">Buying an Existing Business</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch05_s05_s03_s02_p01">If you decide to buy an existing business, some things will be easier. You’ll already have a proven product, current customers, active suppliers, a known location, and trained employees. You’ll also find it much easier to predict the business’s future success. There are, of course, a few bumps in this road to business ownership. First, it’s hard to determine how much you should pay for a business. You can easily determine how much things like buildings and equipment are worth, but how much should you pay for the fact that the business already has steady customers?</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch05_s05_s03_s02_p02">In addition, a business, like a used car, might have performance problems that you can’t detect without a test drive (an option, unfortunately, that you don’t get when you’re buying a business). Perhaps the current owners have disappointed customers; maybe the location isn’t as good as it used to be. You might inherit employees that you wouldn’t have hired yourself. Finally, what if the previous owners set up a competing business that draws away their former—and your current—customers?</p>

        <div class="section" id="collins-ch05_s05_s03_s03">
            <h2 class="title editable block">Getting a Franchise</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch05_s05_s03_s03_p01">Lastly, you can buy a <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">franchise</a><span class="glossdef">Form of business ownership in which a <em class="emphasis">franchiser</em> (a seller) grants a <em class="emphasis">franchisee</em> (a buyer) the right to use a brand name and to sell its products or services.</span></span>. Under this setup, a <em class="emphasis">franchiser</em> (the company that sells the franchise) grants the <em class="emphasis">franchisee</em> (the buyer—you) the right to use a brand name and to sell its goods or services. Franchises market products in a variety of industries, including food, retail, hotels, travel, real estate, business services, cleaning services, and even weight-loss centers and wedding services. There are thousands of franchises, many of which are quite familiar—SUBWAY, McDonald’s, 7-Eleven, Holiday Inn, Budget Car Rental, RadioShack, and Jiffy Lube.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch05_s05_s03_s03_p02">As you can see from <a class="xref" href="#collins-ch05_s05_s03_s03_f01">Figure 5.9 "The Growth of Franchising, 1980–2004"</a>, franchising has become an extremely popular way to do business. A new franchise outlet opens once every eight minutes in the United States, where one in twelve businesses is now a franchise. Franchises employ eight million people and account for 40 percent of all retail sales in this country.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-collins-fn05_031">“Franchise 500,” <em class="emphasis">Entrepreneur.com—Franchise</em>, <a class="link" href="http://www.entrepreneur.com/franchises/rankings/franchise500-115608/2005,-1.html">http://www.entrepreneur.com/franchises/rankings/franchise500-115608/2005,-1.html</a> (accessed April 21, 2006).</span></p>

            </div>
            <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch05_s05_s03_s03_p03">In addition to the right to use a company’s brand name and sell its products, the franchisee gets help in picking a location, starting and operating the business, and advertising. In effect, you’ve bought a prepackaged, ready-to-go business that’s proven successful elsewhere. You also get ongoing support from the franchiser, which has a vested interest in your success.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch05_s05_s03_s03_p04">Not surprisingly, these advantages don’t come cheaply. Franchises can be very expensive, usually depending on the amount of business that a franchisee is expected to do. KFC franchises, for example, require a total investment of $1.1 million to $1.7 million each. This fee includes the cost of the property, equipment, training, start-up costs, and the <em class="emphasis">franchise fee</em>—a one-time charge for the right to operate as a KFC outlet. McDonald’s is in the same price range ($950,000 to $1.8 million). SUBWAY sandwich shops are more affordable, with expected total investment ranging from $80,000 to $310,000. If you’d prefer teaching dance and exercise classes, you could get a Jazzercise franchise for anywhere from $3,000 to $33,000. If you don’t want to deal in food or dance, you might want to buy a dating service. The Right One® franchises go for an initial investment of $100,000 to $250,000, depending on location.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-collins-fn05_032">“2008 Franchise 500,” <em class="emphasis">Entrepreneur.com</em> (2008), <a class="link" href="http://www.entrepreneur.com/franchise500">http://www.entrepreneur.com/franchise500</a> (accessed October 18, 2008).</span></p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch05_s05_s03_s03_p05">In addition to your initial investment, you’ll have to pay two other fees on a monthly basis—a <em class="emphasis">royalty fee</em> (typically from 3 to 12 percent of sales) for continued support from the franchiser and the right to keep using the company’s trade name, plus an <em class="emphasis">advertising fee</em> to cover your share of national and regional advertising. You’ll also be expected to buy your products from the franchiser.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-collins-fn05_033">Michael Seid and Kay Marie Ainsley, “Franchise Fee—Made Simple,” <em class="emphasis">Entrepreneur.com</em>, <a class="link" href="http://www.entrepreneur.com/article/0,4621,299085,00.html">http://www.entrepreneur.com/article/0,4621,299085,00.html</a> (accessed April 21, 2006).</span></p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch05_s05_s03_s03_p06">Why do would-be business owners like franchises? For one thing, buying a franchise lets you start up under fairly safe conditions, with a proven model for running a company and a permanent support team. You can profit from name recognition without having to develop your own image in the marketplace, and you can be your own boss (as long as you comply with the standards set by the franchiser).</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch05_s05_s03_s03_p07">But there are disadvantages. The cost of obtaining and running a franchise can be high, and you have to play by the franchiser’s rules, even when you disagree with them. The franchiser maintains a great deal of control over its franchisees. For example, if you own a fast-food franchise, the franchise agreement will likely dictate the food and beverages you can sell; the methods used to store, prepare, and serve the food; and the prices you’ll charge. In addition, the agreement will dictate what the premises will look like and how they’ll be maintained.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch05_s05_s03_s03_p08">Finally, franchisers don’t always keep their promises. What do you do if the promised advertising or employee training doesn’t materialize? What do you do if you’re forced to make unnecessary and costly alterations to your premises, or the franchising company sets up a competing establishment nearby? What if the franchising company gets bad press, which, in turn, hurts your sales? You always have the option of suing the franchiser, but this is time-consuming and costly. As with any business venture, you need to do your homework before investing in a franchise.</p>

        </ol>
    </div>
    <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch05_s06_p01">If you want to start a business, you must prepare a business plan. This essential document should tell the story of your business concept, provide an overview of the industry in which you will operate, describe the goods or services you will provide, identify your customers and proposed marketing activities, explain the qualifications of your management team, and state your projected income and borrowing needs.</p>
    <div class="section" id="collins-ch05_s06_s01">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Purpose of a Business Plan</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch05_s06_s01_p01">The business plan is a plan or blueprint for the company, and it’s an indispensable tool in attracting investors, obtaining loans, or both. Remember, too, that the value of your business plan isn’t limited to the planning stages of your business and the process of finding start-up money. Once you’ve acquired start-up capital, don’t just stuff your plan in a drawer. Treat it as an ongoing guide to your business and its operations, as well as a yardstick by which you can measure your performance. Keep it handy, update it periodically, and use it to assess your progress.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch05_s06_s01_p02">In developing and writing your business plan, you must make strategic decisions in the areas of management, operations, marketing, accounting, and finance—in short, in all the functional areas of business that we described in <a class="xref" href="collins-ch01#collins-ch01">Chapter 1 "The Foundations of Business"</a>. Granted, preparing a business plan takes a lot of time and work, but it’s well worth the effort. A business plan forces you to think critically about your proposed business and reduces your risk of failure. It forces you to analyze your business concept and the industry in which you’ll be operating, and it helps you determine how you can grab a percentage of sales in that industry.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch05_s06_s01_p03">The most common use of a business plan is persuading investors, lenders, or both, to provide financing. These two groups look for different things. Investors are particularly interested in the quality of your business concept and the ability of management to make your venture successful. Bankers and other lenders are primarily concerned with your company’s ability to generate cash to repay loans. To persuade investors and lenders to support your business, you need a professional, well-written business plan that paints a clear picture of your proposed business.</p>

    <div class="section" id="collins-ch05_s06_s02">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Sections of the Business Plan</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch05_s06_s02_p01">Though formats can vary, a business plan generally includes the following sections: executive summary, description of proposed business, industry analysis, mission statement and core values, management plan, goods or services and (if applicable) production processes, marketing, global issues, and financial plan. Let’s explore each of these sections in more detail. (<em class="emphasis">Note</em>: More detailed documents and an Excel template are available for those classes in which the optional business plan project is assigned.)</p>
        <div class="section" id="collins-ch05_s06_s02_s01">
            <h2 class="title editable block">Executive Summary</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch05_s06_s02_s01_p01">The <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">executive summary</a><span class="glossdef">Overview emphasizing the key points of a business plan to get the reader excited about the business’s prospects.</span></span> is a one- to three-page overview of the business plan. It’s actually the most important part of the business plan: it’s what the reader looks at first, and if it doesn’t capture the reader’s attention, it might be the only thing that he or she looks at. It should therefore emphasize the key points of the plan and get the reader excited about the prospects of the business.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch05_s06_s02_s01_p02">Even though the executive summary is the first thing read, it’s written <em class="emphasis">after</em> the other sections of the plan are completed. An effective approach in writing the executive summary is to paraphrase key sentences from each section of the business plan. This process will ensure that the key information of each section is included in the executive summary.</p>

Given these three conditions, you’ve come up with the idea of starting an on-campus business—selling chocolate chip cookies to fellow students. As a business major, you want to do things right by preparing a business plan. First, you identified a number of specifics about your proposed business. Now, you need to put these various pieces of information into the relevant section of your business plan. Using the business plan format described in this chapter, indicate the section of the business plan into which you’d put each of the following:</p>

                    <li>You’ll bake the cookies in the kitchen of a friend’s apartment.</li>
                    <li>You’ll charge $1 each or $10 a dozen.</li>
                    <li>Your purpose is to make the best cookies on campus and deliver them fresh. You value integrity, consideration of others, and quality.</li>
                    <li>Each cookie will have ten chocolate chips and will be superior to those sold in nearby bakeries and other stores.</li>
                    <li>You expect sales of $6,000 for the first year.</li>
                    <li>Chocolate chip cookies are irresistible to college students. There’s a lot of competition from local bakeries, but your cookies will be superior and popular with college students. You’ll make them close to campus using only fresh ingredients and sell them for $1 each. Your management team is excellent. You expect first-year sales of $6,000 and net income of $1,500. You estimate start-up costs at $600.</li>
                    <li>You’ll place ads for your product in the college newspaper.</li>
                    <li>You’ll hire a vice president at a salary of $100 a week.</li>
                    <li>You can ship cookies anywhere in the United States and in Canada.</li>
                    <li>You need $600 in cash to start the business.</li>
                    <li>There are six bakeries within walking distance of the college.</li>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Why Do Businesses Succeed?</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch05_s07_s01_p01">Being successful as a business owner requires more than coming up with a brilliant idea and working hard. You need to learn how to manage and grow your business. In the process, you’ll face numerous challenges, and your ability to meet them will be a major factor in your success (or failure).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-collins-fn05_035">“D&amp;B—The Challenges of Managing a Small Business,” <a class="link" href="http://www.dnbexpress.ca/ChallengesSmallBusiness.html">http://www.dnbexpress.ca/ChallengesSmallBusiness.html</a> (accessed October 30, 2008).</span> To give yourself a fighting chance in making a success of your business, you should do the following:</p>
        <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="collins-ch05_s07_s01_l01">
            <li>
<em class="emphasis">Know your business</em>. It seems obvious, but it’s worth mentioning: successful businesspeople know what they’re doing. They’re knowledgeable about the industry in which they operate (both as it stands today and where it’s headed), and they know who their competitors are. They know how to attract customers and who the best suppliers and distributors are, and they understand the impact of technology on their business.</li>
            <li>
<em class="emphasis">Know the basics of business management</em>. You might be able to <em class="emphasis">start</em> a business on the basis of a great idea, but to <em class="emphasis">manage</em> it you need to understand the functional areas of business—accounting, finance, management, marketing, and production. You need to be a salesperson, as well as a decision maker and a planner.</li>
            <li>
<em class="emphasis">Have the proper attitude</em>. When you own a business, you <em class="emphasis">are</em> the business. If you’re going to devote the time and energy needed to transform an idea into a successful venture, you need to have a passion for your work. You should believe in what you’re doing and make a strong personal commitment to your business.</li>
            <li>
<em class="emphasis">Get adequate funding</em>. It takes a lot of money to start a business and guide it through the start-up phase (which can last for over a year). You can have the most brilliant idea in the world, the best marketing approach, and a talented management team, yet if you run out of cash, your career as a business owner could be brief. Plan for the long term and work with lenders and investors to ensure that you’ll have sufficient funds to get open, stay open during the start-up phase, and, ultimately, expand.</li>
            <li>
<em class="emphasis">Manage your money effectively</em>. You’ll be under constant pressure to come up with the money to meet payroll and pay your other bills. That’s why you need to keep an eye on <em class="emphasis">cash flow</em>—money coming in and money going out. You need to control costs and collect money that’s owed you, and, generally, you need to know how to gather the financial information that you require to run your business.</li>
            <li>
<em class="emphasis">Manage your time efficiently</em>. A new business owner can expect to work sixty hours a week. If you want to grow a business and have some type of nonwork life at the same time, you’ll have to give up some control—to let others take over some of the work. Thus, you must develop time-management skills and learn how to delegate responsibility.</li>
            <li>
<em class="emphasis">Know how to manage people</em>. Hiring, keeping, and managing good people are crucial to business success. As your business grows, you’ll depend more on your employees. You need to develop a positive working relationship with them, train them properly, and motivate them to provide quality goods or services.</li>
            <li>
<em class="emphasis">Satisfy your customers</em>. You might attract customers through impressive advertising campaigns, but you’ll keep them only by providing quality goods or services. Commit yourself to satisfying—or even exceeding—customer needs.</li>
            <li>
<em class="emphasis">Know how to compete</em>. Find your niche in the marketplace, keep an eye on your competitors, and be prepared to react to changes in the marketplace. The history of business (and much of life) can be summed up in three words: “Adapt or perish.”</li>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Why Do Businesses Fail?</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch05_s07_s02_p01">If you’ve paid attention to the occupancy of shopping malls over a few years, you’ve noticed that retailers come and go with surprising frequency. The same thing happens with restaurants—indeed, with all kinds of businesses. By definition, starting a business—small or large—is risky, and though many businesses succeed, a large proportion of them don’t. One-third of small businesses that have employees go out of business within the first two years. Some 55 percent never celebrate a fourth anniversary.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-collins-fn05_036">Amy E. Knaup, “Survival and Longevity in the Business Employment Dynamics Data,” <em class="emphasis">Monthly Labor Review</em> (May 2005): 50–56, <a class="link" href="http://www.bls.gov/opub/mlr/2005/05/ressum.pdf">http://www.bls.gov/opub/mlr/2005/05/ressum.pdf</a> (accessed October 20, 2008).</span></p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch05_s07_s02_p02">Businesses fail for any number of reasons, but many experts agree that the vast majority of failures result from some combination of the following problems:</p>
        <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="collins-ch05_s07_s02_l01">
            <li>
<em class="emphasis">Bad business idea</em>. Like any idea, a business idea can be flawed, either in the conception or in the execution. If you tried selling snowblowers in Hawaii, you could count on little competition, but you’d still be doomed to failure.</li>
            <li>
<em class="emphasis">Cash problems</em>. Too many new businesses are underfunded. The owner borrows enough money to set up the business but doesn’t have enough extra cash to operate during the start-up phase, when very little money is coming in but a lot is going out.</li>
            <li>
<em class="emphasis">Managerial inexperience or incompetence</em>. Many new business owners have no experience in running a business; many have limited management skills. Maybe an owner knows how to make or market a product but doesn’t know how to manage people. Maybe an owner can’t attract and keep talented employees. Maybe an owner has poor leadership skills and isn’t willing to plan ahead.</li>
            <li>
<em class="emphasis">Lack of customer focus</em>. A major advantage of a small business is the ability to provide special attention to customers. But some small businesses fail to seize this advantage. Perhaps the owner doesn’t anticipate customers’ needs or keep up with changing markets or the customer-focused practices of competitors.</li>
            <li>
<em class="emphasis">Inability to handle growth</em>. You’d think that a sales increase would be a good thing. Often it is, of course, but sometimes it can be a major problem. When a company grows, the owner’s role changes. He or she needs to delegate work to others and build a business structure that can handle the increase in volume. Some owners don’t make the transition and find themselves overwhelmed. Things don’t get done, customers become unhappy, and expansion actually damages the company.</li>

        <p class="para" id="collins-ch05_s08_p05">You and some fellow classmates are sitting around over pizza one night when someone comes up with an idea for a business. All of you have old term papers and essays lying around, and a couple of you know how to set up a Web page. What if you combine these two assets and start a business selling term papers over the Internet? Over time, you could collect or buy additional inventory from other students, and since some of you are good at research and others are good writers, you could even offer “student clients” the option of customized papers researched and written just for them. You figure that you can charge $15 for an “off-the-rack” paper, and for customized jobs, $10 per double-spaced page seems reasonable.</p>
        <p class="para" id="collins-ch05_s08_p06">You all agree that the idea is promising, and you and a partner volunteer to put together a business plan. You have no difficulty with the section describing your proposed business: you know what your business will do, what products it will offer, who your customers will be, how your products will be sold, and where you’ll be located. So far, so good.</p>
        <p class="para" id="collins-ch05_s08_p07">Let’s pause at this point to consider the following questions:</p>
        <ol class="orderedlist" id="collins-ch05_s08_l04">
            <li>Does selling term papers over the Internet make business sense? Is it a good business idea?</li>
            <li>Could the venture be profitable?</li>
        </ol>
        <p class="para" id="collins-ch05_s08_p08">Let’s continue and find out how the business plan proceeds.</p>
        <p class="para" id="collins-ch05_s08_p09">Now you’re ready to write your section on industry analysis and the first question you need to answer is, Who are the players in the industry? To get some answers, you go online, log on to Google, and enter the search term “term papers for sale.” Much to your surprise, up pop dozens of links to companies that have beaten you to market. The first company you investigate claims to have a quarter-million papers in stock, plus a team of graduate students on hand to write papers for anyone needing specialized work.</p>
        <p class="para" id="collins-ch05_s08_p10">There’s also a statement that says something like this: “Our term papers and essays are intended to help students write their own papers. They should be used for research purposes only. Students using our term papers and essays should write their own papers and cite our work.”</p>
        <p class="para" id="collins-ch05_s08_p11">You realize now that you’re facing not only stiff competition but an issue that, so far, you and your partners have preferred to ignore: Is the business that you have in mind even ethical? It occurs to you that you could probably find the answer to this question in at least one of the 8,484 term papers on ethics available on your competitor’s Web site, but you decide that it would be more efficient to give the question some thought on your own.</p>
        <p class="para" id="collins-ch05_s08_p12">At this point, then, let’s pause again to identify a couple of questions that you need to ask yourself as you prepare a report of your findings for your partners:</p>
        <ol class="orderedlist" id="collins-ch05_s08_l05">
            <li>Is the sole purpose of running a business to make a profit, or do you need to be concerned about what your products will be used for? Explain your reasoning.</li>
            <li>Do you need to consider the ethics of what other people do with your product? Explain your reasoning.</li>
        </ol>
        <p class="para" id="collins-ch05_s08_p13">When you report on the problem that you’ve uncovered, your would-be partners are pretty discouraged, some by the prospect of competition and some by the nagging ethical issue. Just as you’re about to dissolve the partnership, one person speaks up: “How about selling software that lets faculty search to see if students have plagiarized material on the Web?”</p>
        <p class="para" id="collins-ch05_s08_p14">“Sorry,” says someone else. “It’s already out there. Two students at Berkeley have software that compares papers to a hundred million Web pages.”</p>

        <h3 class="title">Team-Building Skills (AACSB)</h3>
        <p class="para" id="collins-ch05_s08_p15">Knowing how to be an effective team member is a vital lifetime skill. It will help you in your academic career, in the business world, and in nonwork activities as well. It takes time and effort to learn how to work in a team. Part of the challenge is learning how to adjust your behavior to the needs of the group. Another part is learning how to motivate members of a group. A well-functioning team allows members to combine knowledge and skills, and this reliance on diverse backgrounds and strengths often results in team decisions that are superior to those made by individuals working alone.</p>
        <p class="simpara">Are You a Team Player?</p>
        <p class="para" id="collins-ch05_s08_p16">As a first step, you should do a self-assessment to evaluate whether you possess characteristics that will help you be a successful team member. You can do this by taking a “Team Player” quiz available at the Monster.com Web site. Go to <a class="link" href="http://content.monster.ie/tools/quizzes/teamplayer">http://content.monster.ie/tools/quizzes/teamplayer</a> to link to this quiz. You’ll get feedback that helps you identify the characteristics you need to work on if you want to improve your teamwork skills.</p>
        <p class="simpara">Working Together as a Team</p>
        <p class="para" id="collins-ch05_s08_p17">The best approach to specifying appropriate behavior for team members is for the team to come up with some ground rules. Get together with three other students selected by your instructor, and establish working guidelines for your team. Prepare a team report in which you identify the following:</p>
        <ol class="orderedlist" id="collins-ch05_s08_l06" numeration="loweralpha">
            <li>Five things that team members can do to increase the likelihood of group success</li>
            <li>Five things that team members can do to jeopardize group success</li>
        </ol>

        <h3 class="title">The Global View (AACSB)</h3>
        <p class="simpara">Global Versions of MySpace</p>
        <p class="para" id="collins-ch05_s08_p18">When Chris DeWolfe and Tom Anderson founded MySpace in July 2003, they had no idea that they were headed for an overnight success, but two and one-half years after they set out on their entrepreneurial adventure (which, admittedly, isn’t actually overnight), MySpace had nearly fifty million users in the United States. One in ten ads viewed on the Internet was seen on the MySpace site. Its popularity caught the attention of news and entertainment mogul Rupert Murdoch, whose News Corporation dished out $580 million for MySpace while allowing its founders to stay on as CEO and president.</p>
        <p class="para" id="collins-ch05_s08_p19">What’s ahead for MySpace? Can its business model be exported outside the United States? Murdoch thinks so; as soon as he’d acquired the U.S. company, he launched a British version of the site. If you were in charge of global expansion for MySpace, what country would you enter next? What country would you avoid? To identify promising and not-so-promising foreign markets, go to <a class="link" href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/country_profiles/default.stm">http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/country_profiles/default.stm</a> to link to the Country Profiles Web site maintained by BBC News. Study the economic and political profiles of possible overseas locations, and answer the following questions:</p>
        <ol class="orderedlist" id="collins-ch05_s08_l07">
            <li>Why do you think MySpace has been so successful in the United States? Cite some of the challenges that it still faces in this country.</li>
            <li>If you were in charge of global expansion at MySpace, which country would you enter next? Why do you think the MySpace business concept will succeed in this country? What challenges will the company face there?</li>
            <li>What country would you avoid? Why is it incompatible with the MySpace business concept?</li>
        </ol>
