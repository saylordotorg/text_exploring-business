            <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch08_s01_s01_s01_p01">“A group,” suggests Bonnie Edelstein, a consultant in organizational development, “is a bunch of people in an elevator. A team is also a bunch of people in an elevator, but the elevator is broken.” This distinction may be a little oversimplified, but as our tale of teamwork at Motorola reminds us, a <em class="emphasis">team</em> is clearly something more than a mere <em class="emphasis">group</em> of individuals. In particular, members of a group—or, more accurately, a <em class="emphasis">working group</em>—go about their jobs independently and meet primarily to share information. A group of department-store managers, for example, might meet monthly to discuss their progress in cutting plant costs, but each manager is focused on the goals of his or her department because each is held accountable for meeting only those goals. Teams, by contrast, are responsible for achieving specific common goals, and they’re generally empowered to make the decisions needed to complete their authorized tasks.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Why Organizations Build Teams</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch08_s01_s02_p01">Why do major organizations now rely more and more on teams to improve operations? Executives at Xerox have reported that team-based operations are 30 percent more productive than conventional operations. General Mills says that factories organized around team activities are 40 percent more productive than traditionally organized factories. According to in-house studies at Shenandoah Life Insurance, teams have cut case-handling time from twenty-seven to two days and virtually eliminated service complaints. FedEx says that teams reduced service errors (lost packages, incorrect bills) by 13 percent in the first year.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-collins-fn08_004">Kimball Fisher, <em class="emphasis">Leading Self-Directed Work Teams: A Guide to Developing New Team Leadership Skills</em>, rev. ed.

        <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch08_s01_s02_p02">Today it seems obvious that teams can address a variety of challenges in the world of corporate activity. Before we go any further, however, we should remind ourselves that data like those we’ve just cited aren’t necessarily definitive. For one thing, they may not be objective—companies are more likely to report successes than failures. As a matter of fact, teams <em class="emphasis">don’t</em> always work. Indeed, according to one study, team-based projects fail 50 to 70 percent of the time.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-collins-fn08_005">Jerald Greenberg and Robert A.

        <h2 class="title editable block">Types of Teams</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch08_s01_s03_p01">Teams, then, can improve company and individual performance in a number of areas. Not all teams, however, are formed to achieve the same goals or charged with the same responsibilities. Nor are they organized in the same way. Some, for instance, are more <em class="emphasis">autonomous</em> than others—less accountable to those higher up in the organization. Some depend on a team leader who’s responsible for defining the team’s goals and making sure that its activities are performed effectively. Others are more or less self-governing: though a leader lays out overall goals and strategies, the team itself chooses and manages the methods by which it pursues its goals and implements its strategies.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-collins-fn08_006">See Leigh L. Thompson, <em class="emphasis">Making the Team: A Guide for Managers</em> (Upper Saddle River, NJ: Pearson Education, 2008), 8–13.</span> Teams also vary according to their membership. Let’s look at several categories of teams.</p>
        <div class="section" id="collins-ch08_s01_s03_s01">
            <h2 class="title editable block">Manager-Led Teams</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch08_s01_s03_s01_p01">As its name implies, in the <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">manager-led team</a><span class="glossdef">Team on which a manager defines goals and methods and is solely responsible for interactions with higher-level management.</span></span> the manager is the team leader and is in charge of setting team goals, assigning tasks, and monitoring the team’s performance. The individual team members have relatively little autonomy. For example, the key employees of a professional football team (a manager-led team) are highly trained (and highly paid) athletes, but their activities on the field are tightly controlled by a head coach. As team manager, the coach is responsible both for developing the strategies by which the team pursues its goal of winning games and for the final outcome of each game (not to mention the season). He’s also solely responsible for interacting with managers above him in the organization. The players are responsible only for executing plays.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-collins-fn08_007">Leigh L. Thompson, <em class="emphasis">Making the Team: A Guide for Managers</em> (Upper Saddle River, NJ: Pearson Education, 2008), 9.</span></p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch08_s01_s03_s02_p01"><span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Self-managing teams</a><span class="glossdef">Team on which employees control the activities needed to meet overall goals.</span></span> (also known as <em class="emphasis">self-directed</em> or <em class="emphasis">self-regulating teams</em>) have considerable autonomy. They are usually small and often absorb activities that were once performed by traditional supervisors. A manager or team leader may determine overall goals, but the members of the self-managing team control the activities needed to achieve the goals, such as planning and scheduling work, sharing tasks, meeting quality standards, and handling day-to-day operations.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch08_s01_s03_s02_p02">Self-managing teams are the organizational hallmark of Whole Foods Market, the largest natural-foods grocer in the United States. Each store is run by ten teams (produce, prepared foods, and so forth), and virtually every store employee is a member of a team. Each team has a designated leader and its own performance targets. (Team leaders also belong to a store team, and store-team leaders belong to a regional team.) To do its job, every team has access to the kind of information—including sales and even salary figures—that most companies reserve for the eyes of traditional managers.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-collins-fn08_008">Charles Fishman, “Whole Foods Is All Teams,” <em class="emphasis">Fast Company.com</em>, December 18, 2007, <a class="link" href="http://www.fastcompany.com/node/26671/print">http://www.fastcompany.com/node/26671/print</a> (accessed August 26, 2007).</span></p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch08_s01_s03_s02_p03">Needless to say, not every self-managed team enjoys the same degree of autonomy. Companies vary widely in choosing which tasks teams are allowed to manage and which ones are best left to upper-level management only. As you can see in <a class="xref" href="#collins-ch08_s01_s03_s02_f01">Figure 8.2 "What Teams Do (and Don’t) Manage"</a>, for example, self-managing teams are often allowed to schedule assignments, but they are rarely allowed to fire coworkers.</p>

A cross-functional team is designed to take advantage of the special expertise of members drawn from different functional areas of the company. When the Internal Revenue Service, for example, wanted to study the effects on employees of a major change in information systems, it created a cross-functional team composed of people from a wide range of departments. The final study reflected expertise in such areas as job analysis, training, change management, industrial psychology, and even ergonomics.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-collins-fn08_009">Human Technology Inc., “Organizational Learning Strategies: Cross-Functional Teams,” <em class="emphasis">Getting Results through Learning</em>, <a class="link" href="http://www.humtech.com/opm/grtl/ols/ols3.cfm">http://www.humtech.com/opm/grtl/ols/ols3.cfm</a> (accessed August 26, 2008).</span></p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch08_s01_s03_s03_p02">Cross-functional teams figure prominently in the product-development process at Nike, where they take advantage of expertise from both inside and outside the company. Typically, team members include not only product designers, marketing specialists, and accountants, but also sports-research experts, coaches, athletes, and even consumers. Likewise, Motorola’s RAZR team was a cross-functional team: Responsibility for developing the new product wasn’t passed along from the design team to the engineering team, but rather was entrusted to a special team composed of both designers and engineers.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch08_s01_s03_s03_p03">We can also classify the RAZR team as a <em class="emphasis">product-development</em> or <em class="emphasis">project team</em> (a topic we’ll discuss in more detail in <a class="xref" href="collins-ch10#collins-ch10">Chapter 10 "Product Design and Development"</a>). <em class="emphasis">Committees</em> and <em class="emphasis">task forces</em>, both of which are dedicated to specific issues or tasks, are often cross-functional teams. <em class="emphasis">Problem-solving teams</em>, which are created to study such issues as improving quality or reducing waste, may be either intradepartmental or cross-functional.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-collins-fn08_010">See Stephen P.
