        <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch08_s00_p01">The mood was grim at Motorola in winter 2003, especially in the cell phone division: The company that for years had run ringtones around the competition had been bumped from the top spot in worldwide sales.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-collins-fn08_001">This vignette is based on the following sources: Adam Lashinsky, “RAZR’s Edge,” <em class="emphasis">Fortune</em>, <em class="emphasis">CNNMoney.com</em>, June 1, 2006, <a class="link" href="http://money.cnn.com/magazines/fortune/fortune_archive/2006/06/12/8379239/index.htm">http://money.cnn.com/magazines/fortune/fortune_archive/2006/06/12/8379239/index.htm</a> (accessed August 22, 2008); Scott D.

Why had sales at Motorola been put on hold? Among other things, consumers were less than enthusiastic about the uninspired <em class="emphasis">style</em> of Motorola phones, and make no mistake about it—for a lot of people, style is just as important in picking a cell phone as its features list. As a reviewer for one industry publication puts it, “With some phones, we just want to see the look on people’s faces when we slide it out of our pockets to take a call.”</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch08_s00_p02">And yet, there was a glimmer of hope at Motorola. Despite its recent lapse in cell phone fashion sense, Motorola (like just about every other maker of wireless hardware) still maintained a <em class="emphasis">concept-phone</em> unit—a group responsible for designing futuristic new product features such as speech-recognition capability, liquid batteries, flexible touchscreens, and touch-sensitive body covers. Now, in every concept-phone unit, developers are engaged in an ongoing struggle to balance the two often-opposing demands of cell phone design: how to build the smallest possible phone with the largest possible screen. The previous year, designers in the Motorola concept-phone unit had unveiled the rough model of an ultratrim phone—at 10 millimeters, about half the width of the average flip-top or “clamshell” design. It was on this concept that Motorola decided to stake the revival of its reputation as a cell phone maker who knew how to package functionality with a wow factor.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch08_s00_p03">The next step in developing a concept phone, of course, is actually <em class="emphasis">building</em> it. And this is where teamwork comes in. For one thing, you need a little diversity in your expertise. An <em class="emphasis">electronic engineer</em>, for example, knows how to apply energy to transmit information through a system but not how to apply physics to the design and manufacture of the system; that’s the specialty of a <em class="emphasis">mechanical engineer</em>. And engineers aren’t <em class="emphasis">designers</em>—the specialists who know how to enhance the marketability of a product by adding aesthetic value.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch08_s00_p04">In addition, when you set out to build any kind of innovative high-tech product, you need to become a master of <em class="emphasis">trade-offs</em>—in Motorola’s case, the compromises resulting from the demands of state-of-the-art functionality on the one hand and fashionable design on the other. <em class="emphasis">Negotiating trade-offs is a team sport</em>: it takes at least two people, for example, to resolve such disputes as whether you can put the antenna of a cell phone inside its mouthpiece or whether you should put the caller-ID display inside or outside the flip-top.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch08_s00_p05">The responsibility for assembling and managing the Motorola “thin-clam” team fell to veteran electronic engineer Roger Jellicoe. His mission: create the world’s thinnest phone, do it in one year, and try to keep it a secret. Before the project was completed, the team had grown to more than twenty members, and with increased creative input and enthusiasm came increased confidence and clout. Jellicoe, for instance, had been warned by company specialists in such matters that no phone wider than 49 millimeters could be held comfortably in the human hand. When the team had finally arrived at a satisfactory design that couldn’t work at less than 53 millimeters, they ignored the “49 millimeters warning,” built a model, handed it around, and came to a consensus: As one team member put it, “People could hold it in their hands and say, ‘Yeah, it doesn’t feel like a brick.’” Four millimeters, they decided, was an acceptable trade-off, and the new phone went to market at 53 millimeters.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch08_s00_p06">Team members liked to call this process the “dance.” Sometimes it flowed smoothly and sometimes people stepped on one another’s toes, but for the most part, the team moved in lock step toward its goal. After a series of trade-offs about what to call the final product (suggestions ranged from <em class="emphasis">Razor Clam</em> to <em class="emphasis">V3</em>), Motorola’s new RAZR was introduced in July 2004. Recall that the product was originally conceived as a high-tech toy—something to restore the luster to Motorola’s tarnished image. It wasn’t supposed to set sales records, and sales in the fourth quarter of 2004, though promising, were in fact fairly modest. Back in September, however, a new executive named Ron Garriques had taken over Motorola’s cell phone division, and one of his first decisions was to raise the bar for RAZR. Disregarding a 2005 budget that called for sales of two million units, Garriques pushed expected sales for the RAZR up to twenty million. The RAZR topped that target, shipped ten million in the first quarter of 2006, and hit the fifty-million mark at midyear. Talking on a RAZR, declared hip-hop luminary Sean “P. Diddy” Combs, “is like driving a Mercedes versus a regular ol’ ride.”</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch08_s00_p07">As for Jellicoe and his team, they were invited to attend an event hosted by top executives. As they walked into the room, they received a standing ovation—along with a cartload of stock options—and outside observers applauded them for revitalizing “the stodgy, engineering-driven, Midwestern company that was Motorola.” One of the reasons for the RAZR’s success, admits Jellicoe, “was that it took the world by surprise. Very few Motorola products do that.” After the introduction of the RAZR, perceptions of the company’s flair for fashion and innovation underwent a critical change: “Now,” reports Jellicoe, “whenever we say we have this secret program we’re working on, nobody wants to be left out….It’s kicked down some doors…and gets us noticed. It really is a tremendous brand builder. As for credibility in the marketplace, it’s been a very big win.”</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch08_s01_s01_s01_p01">“A group,” suggests Bonnie Edelstein, a consultant in organizational development, “is a bunch of people in an elevator. A team is also a bunch of people in an elevator, but the elevator is broken.” This distinction may be a little oversimplified, but as our tale of teamwork at Motorola reminds us, a <em class="emphasis">team</em> is clearly something more than a mere <em class="emphasis">group</em> of individuals. In particular, members of a group—or, more accurately, a <em class="emphasis">working group</em>—go about their jobs independently and meet primarily to share information. A group of department-store managers, for example, might meet monthly to discuss their progress in cutting plant costs, but each manager is focused on the goals of his or her department because each is held accountable for meeting only those goals. Teams, by contrast, are responsible for achieving specific common goals, and they’re generally empowered to make the decisions needed to complete their authorized tasks.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Why Organizations Build Teams</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch08_s01_s02_p01">Why do major organizations now rely more and more on teams to improve operations? Executives at Xerox have reported that team-based operations are 30 percent more productive than conventional operations. General Mills says that factories organized around team activities are 40 percent more productive than traditionally organized factories. According to in-house studies at Shenandoah Life Insurance, teams have cut case-handling time from twenty-seven to two days and virtually eliminated service complaints. FedEx says that teams reduced service errors (lost packages, incorrect bills) by 13 percent in the first year.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-collins-fn08_004">Kimball Fisher, <em class="emphasis">Leading Self-Directed Work Teams: A Guide to Developing New Team Leadership Skills</em>, rev. ed.

(Upper Saddle River, NJ: Pearson Education, 2008), 315–16.</span></p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch08_s01_s02_p02">Today it seems obvious that teams can address a variety of challenges in the world of corporate activity. Before we go any further, however, we should remind ourselves that data like those we’ve just cited aren’t necessarily definitive. For one thing, they may not be objective—companies are more likely to report successes than failures. As a matter of fact, teams <em class="emphasis">don’t</em> always work.

        <h2 class="title editable block">Types of Teams</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch08_s01_s03_p01">Teams, then, can improve company and individual performance in a number of areas. Not all teams, however, are formed to achieve the same goals or charged with the same responsibilities. Nor are they organized in the same way. Some, for instance, are more <em class="emphasis">autonomous</em> than others—less accountable to those higher up in the organization. Some depend on a team leader who’s responsible for defining the team’s goals and making sure that its activities are performed effectively. Others are more or less self-governing: though a leader lays out overall goals and strategies, the team itself chooses and manages the methods by which it pursues its goals and implements its strategies.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-collins-fn08_006">See Leigh L. Thompson, <em class="emphasis">Making the Team: A Guide for Managers</em> (Upper Saddle River, NJ: Pearson Education, 2008), 8–13.</span> Teams also vary according to their membership. Let’s look at several categories of teams.</p>

The individual team members have relatively little autonomy. For example, the key employees of a professional football team (a manager-led team) are highly trained (and highly paid) athletes, but their activities on the field are tightly controlled by a head coach. As team manager, the coach is responsible both for developing the strategies by which the team pursues its goal of winning games and for the final outcome of each game (not to mention the season). He’s also solely responsible for interacting with managers above him in the organization. The players are responsible only for executing plays.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-collins-fn08_007">Leigh L.

Each store is run by ten teams (produce, prepared foods, and so forth), and virtually every store employee is a member of a team. Each team has a designated leader and its own performance targets. (Team leaders also belong to a store team, and store-team leaders belong to a regional team.) To do its job, every team has access to the kind of information—including sales and even salary figures—that most companies reserve for the eyes of traditional managers.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-collins-fn08_008">Charles Fishman, “Whole Foods Is All Teams,” <em class="emphasis">Fast Company.com</em>, December 18, 2007, <a class="link" href="http://www.fastcompany.com/node/26671/print">http://www.fastcompany.com/node/26671/print</a> (accessed August 26, 2007).</span></p>

A cross-functional team is designed to take advantage of the special expertise of members drawn from different functional areas of the company. When the Internal Revenue Service, for example, wanted to study the effects on employees of a major change in information systems, it created a cross-functional team composed of people from a wide range of departments.

    <div class="section" id="collins-ch08_s02_s01">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Factors in Effective Teamwork</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch08_s02_s01_p01">First, let’s begin by identifying several factors that, in practice, tend to contribute to effective teamwork. Generally speaking, teams are effective when the following factors are met:<span class="footnote" id="fwk-collins-fn08_013">This section is based on David A. Whetten and Kim S. Cameron, <em class="emphasis">Developing Management Skills</em>, 7th ed. (Upper Saddle River, NJ: Pearson Education, 2007), 497.</span></p>
        <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="collins-ch08_s02_s01_l01">
            <li>
<em class="emphasis">Members depend on each other</em>. When team members rely on each other to get the job done, team productivity and efficiency are high.</li>
            <li>
<em class="emphasis">Members trust one another</em>. Teamwork is more effective when members trust each other.</li>
            <li>
<em class="emphasis">Members work better together than individually</em>. When team members perform better as a group than alone, collective performance exceeds individual performance.</li>
            <li>
<em class="emphasis">Members become boosters</em>. When each member is encouraged by other team members to do his or her best, collective results improve.</li>
            <li>
<em class="emphasis">Team members enjoy being on the team</em>. The more that team members derive satisfaction from being on the team, the more committed they become.</li>
            <li>
<em class="emphasis">Leadership rotates</em>. Teams function effectively when leadership responsibility is shared over time.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch08_s02_s01_p02">Most of these explanations probably make pretty clear intuitive sense. Unfortunately, because such issues are rarely as clear-cut as they may seem at first glance, we need to examine the issue of group effectiveness from another perspective—one that considers the effects of factors that aren’t quite so straightforward.</p>
        <div class="section" id="collins-ch08_s02_s01_s01">
            <h2 class="title editable block">Group Cohesiveness</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch08_s02_s01_s01_p01">The idea of <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">group cohesiveness</a><span class="glossdef">Principle that groups are most effective when members like being members.</span></span> refers to the <em class="emphasis">attractiveness</em> of a team to its members. If a group is high in cohesiveness, membership is quite satisfying to its members; if it’s low in cohesiveness, members are unhappy with it and may even try to leave it. The principle of group cohesiveness, in other words, is based on the simple idea that groups are most effective when their members like being members of the group.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-collins-fn08_014">This section is based mostly on Jennifer M. George and Gareth R. Jones, <em class="emphasis">Understanding and Managing Organizational Behavior</em>, 5th ed. (Upper Saddle River, NJ: Pearson Education, 2008), 371–77.

                <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch08_s02_s01_s01_s01_p01">Numerous factors may contribute to team cohesiveness, but in this section, we’ll focus on five of the most important:</p>
                <ol class="orderedlist editable block" id="collins-ch08_s02_s01_s01_s01_l01">
                    <li>
<em class="emphasis">Size</em>. The bigger the team, the less satisfied members tend to be. When teams get too large, members find it harder to interact closely with other members; a few members tend to dominate team activities, and conflict becomes more likely.</li>
                    <li>
<em class="emphasis">Similarity</em>. People usually get along better with people like themselves, and teams are generally more cohesive when members perceive fellow members as people who share their own attitudes and experience.</li>
                    <li>
<em class="emphasis">Success</em>. When teams are successful, members are satisfied, and other people are more likely to be attracted to their teams.</li>
                    <li>
<em class="emphasis">Exclusiveness</em>. The harder it is to get into a group, the happier the people who are already in it. Status (the extent to which outsiders look up to a team, as well as the perks that come with membership) also increases members’ satisfaction.</li>
                    <li>
<em class="emphasis">Competition</em>. Members value membership more highly when they’re motivated to achieve common goals—especially when those goals mean outperforming other teams.</li>
                </ol>

                <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch08_s02_s01_s01_s01_p02">There’s such a thing as too much cohesiveness. When, for instance, members are highly motivated to collaborate in performing the team’s activities, the team is more likely to be effective in achieving its goals. Clearly, when those goals are aligned with the goals of the larger organization, the organization, too, will be happy. If, however, its members get too wrapped up in more immediate team goals, the whole team may lose sight of the larger organizational goals toward which it’s supposed to be working.</p>

                <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch08_s02_s01_s01_s02_p01">Likewise, it’s easier for leaders to direct members toward team goals when members are all on the same page—when there’s a basic willingness to conform to the team’s rules and guidelines. When there’s too much conformity, however, the group can become ineffective: It may resist change and fresh ideas and, what’s worse, may end up adopting its own dysfunctional tendencies as its way of doing things.

        <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch08_s02_s02_p01">Teams don’t always work. To learn why, let’s take a quick look at four common obstacles to success in introducing teams into an organization:<span class="footnote" id="fwk-collins-fn08_016">This section is based on Jerald Greenberg and Robert A. Baron, <em class="emphasis">Behavior in Organizations</em>, 9th ed. (Upper Saddle River, NJ: Pearson Education, 2008), 317–18.</span></p>
        <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="collins-ch08_s02_s02_l01">
            <li>
<em class="emphasis">Unwillingness to cooperate</em>. Failure to cooperate can occur when members don’t or won’t commit to a common goal or set of activities. What if, for example, half the members of a product-development team want to create a brand-new product and half want to improve an existing product? The entire team may get stuck on this point of contention for weeks or even months.</li>
            <li>
<em class="emphasis">Lack of managerial support</em>. Every team requires organizational resources to achieve its goals, and if management isn’t willing to commit the needed resources—say, funding or key personnel—a team will probably fall short of those goals.</li>
            <li>
<em class="emphasis">Failure of managers to delegate authority</em>. Team leaders are often chosen from the ranks of successful supervisors—first-line managers who, as we saw in <a class="xref" href="collins-ch06#collins-ch06">Chapter 6 "Managing for Business Success"</a>, give instructions on a day-to-day basis and expect to have them carried out. This approach to workplace activities may not work very well in leading a team—a position in which success depends on building a consensus and letting people make their own decisions.</li>
            <li>
<em class="emphasis">Failure of teams to cooperate</em>. If you’re on a workplace team, your employer probably depends on teams to perform much of the organization’s work and meet many of its goals. In other words, it is, to some extent, a team-based organization, and as such, reaching its overall goals requires a high level of cooperation <em class="emphasis">among teams</em>.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-collins-fn08_017">See Leigh L. Thompson, <em class="emphasis">Making the Team: A Guide for Managers</em> (Upper Saddle River, NJ: Pearson Education, 2008), 323–24.</span> When teams can’t agree on mutual goals (or when they duplicate efforts), neither the teams nor the organization is likely to meet with much success.</li>

As members of workplace teams, they need motivation, and as we observed in <a class="xref" href="collins-ch07#collins-ch07">Chapter 7 "Recruiting, Motivating, and Keeping Quality Employees"</a>, when motivation is down, so are effectiveness and productivity. As you can see in <a class="xref" href="#collins-ch08_s02_s02_s01_f01">Figure 8.4 "Sources of Frustration"</a>, the difficulty of maintaining a high level of motivation is the chief cause of frustration among members of teams.

        <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch08_s03_s01_p05">She’s right. In placing so much emphasis on teamwork skills and experience, college business departments are doing the responsible thing—preparing students for the business world that awaits them. A survey of <em class="emphasis">Fortune</em> 1000 companies reveals that 79 percent already rely on self-managing teams and 91 percent on various forms of employee work groups. Another survey found that the skill that most employers value in new employees is the ability to work in teams.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-collins-fn08_021">David A. Whetten and Kim S.

Lawler, <em class="emphasis">Treat People Right</em> (San Francisco: Jossey-Bass, 2003).</span> If you’re already trying to work your way up an organizational ladder, consider the advice of former Chrysler Chairman Lee Iacocca: “A major reason that capable people fail to advance is that they don’t work well with their colleagues.”<span class="footnote" id="fwk-collins-fn08_022">Quoted by Terry L.

(stop moving up in the organization),” 60 percent of the organizations cited “inability to work in teams.” Interestingly, only 9 percent attributed the failure of these executives to advance to “lack of technical ability.” While technical skills will be essential in your getting hired into an organization, your team skills will play a significant role in your ability to advance.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch08_s03_s01_p06">To be team-ready or not to be team-ready—that is the question. Or, to put it in plainer terms, the question is not whether you’ll find yourself working as part of a team. You will. The question is whether you’ll know how to participate successfully in team-based activities.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch08_s03_s02_p01">What if your instructor in this course decides to divide the class into several three-, four-, or five-member teams and assigns each team to develop a new product plus a business plan to get it into production and out on the market?

            <h2 class="title editable block">What Skills Does the Team Need?</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch08_s03_s02_s01_p01">Sometimes we hear about a sports team made up of mostly average players who win a championship because of coaching genius, flawless teamwork, and superhuman determination.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-collins-fn08_024">This section is based on Stephen P. Robbins and Timothy A. Judge, <em class="emphasis">Organizational Behavior</em>, 13th ed. (Upper Saddle River, NJ: Pearson Education, 2009), 346–47.</span> But not terribly often. In fact, we usually hear about such teams simply because they’re newsworthy—exceptions to the rule. Typically a team performs well because its members possess some level of talent. This doesn’t mean, however, that we should reduce team performance to the mere sum of its individual contributions: Members’ talents aren’t very useful if they’re not managed in a collective effort to achieve a common goal.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch08_s03_s02_s01_p02">In the final analysis, of course, a team can succeed only if its members provide the skills that need managing. In particular, every team requires some mixture of three sets of skills (notice, by the way, that these skill sets overlap considerably with the managerial skill sets that we discussed in <a class="xref" href="collins-ch06#collins-ch06">Chapter 6 "Managing for Business Success"</a>):</p>
            <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="collins-ch08_s03_s02_s01_l01">
                <li>
<em class="emphasis">Technical skills</em>. Because teams must perform certain tasks, they need people with the skills to perform them. For example, if your project calls for a lot of math work, it’s good to have someone with the necessary quantitative skills.</li>
                <li>
<em class="emphasis">Decision-making and problem-solving skills</em>. Because every task is subject to problems, and because handling every problem means deciding on the best solution, it’s good to have members who are skilled in identifying problems, evaluating alternative solutions, and deciding on the best options.</li>
                <li>
<em class="emphasis">Interpersonal skills</em>. Because teams are composed of people, and because people need direction and motivation and depend on communication, every group benefits from members who know how to listen, provide feedback, and smooth ruffled feathers. The same people are usually good at communicating the team’s goals and needs to outsiders.</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch08_s03_s02_s01_p03">The key to success is ultimately the right mix of these skills. Remember, too, that no team needs to possess all these skills—never mind the right balance of them—from day one. In many cases, a team gains certain skills only when members volunteer for certain tasks and perfect their skills in the process of performing them. For the same reason, effective teamwork develops over time as team members learn how to handle various team-based tasks. In a sense, teamwork is always work in progress.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch08_s03_s02_s02_p01">Like your teamwork skills, expect your role on a team to develop over time. Also remember that, both as a student and as a member of the workforce, you’ll be a <em class="emphasis">member</em> of a team more often than a <em class="emphasis">leader</em> (a subject that we’ll take up in the next section). Team members, however, can have as much impact on a team’s success as its leaders. The key is the quality of the contributions they make in performing nonleadership roles.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-collins-fn08_025">This section is based on David A. Whetten and Kim S.

            <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch08_s03_s02_s02_p02">What, exactly, are those roles? At this point, you’ve probably concluded that every team faces two basic challenges:</p>
            <ol class="orderedlist editable block" id="collins-ch08_s03_s02_s02_l01">
                <li>Accomplishing its assigned task</li>
                <li>Maintaining or improving group cohesiveness</li>
            </ol>
            <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch08_s03_s02_s02_p03">Whether you affect the team’s work positively or negatively depends on the extent to which you help it or hinder it in meeting these two challenges.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-collins-fn08_026">David A. Whetten and Kim S. Cameron, <em class="emphasis">Developing Management Skills</em>, 7th ed. (Upper Saddle River, NJ: Pearson Education, 2007), 516–17.</span> We can thus divide teamwork roles into two categories, depending on which of these two challenges each role addresses. These two categories (task-facilitating roles and relationship-building roles) are summarized in <a class="xref" href="#collins-ch08_s03_s02_s02_t01">Table 8.2 "Roles That Team Members Play"</a>.</p>

                <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch08_s03_s02_s02_s02_p01">When you challenge unmotivated behavior or help other team members understand their roles, you’re performing a <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">relationship-building role</a><span class="glossdef">Member role that helps a team maintain or improve group cohesiveness.</span></span> and addressing challenge number two—maintaining or improving group cohesiveness. This type of role includes just about every activity that improves team “chemistry,” from <em class="emphasis">confronting</em> to <em class="emphasis">empathizing</em>.</p>
                <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch08_s03_s02_s02_s02_p02">Bear in mind three points about this model of team-membership roles: (1) Teams are most effective when there’s a good balance between task facilitation and relationship building; (2) it’s hard for any given member to perform both types of roles, as some people are better at focusing on tasks and others on relationships; and (3) overplaying any facet of any role can easily become counterproductive. For example, <em class="emphasis">elaborating</em> on something may not be the best strategy when the team needs to make a quick decision; and <em class="emphasis">consensus building</em> may cause the team to overlook an important difference of opinion.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Class Team Projects</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch08_s03_s03_p01">As we highlighted earlier, throughout your academic career you’ll likely participate in a number of team projects. Not only will you make lasting friends by being a member of a team, but in addition you’ll produce a better product. To get insider advice on how to survive team projects in college (and perhaps really enjoy yourself in the process), let’s look at some suggestions offered by two students who have gone through this experience.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-collins-fn08_027">Hannah Nichols, “Teamwork in School, Work and Life,” iamnext.com 2003,<a class="link" href="http://www.iamnext.com/academics/groupwork.html">http://www.iamnext.com/academics/groupwork.html</a> (accessed August 10, 2008); and Kristin Feenstra, “Study Skills: Team Work Skills for Group Projects,” <em class="emphasis">iamnext.com</em>, 2002, <a class="link" href="http://www.iamnext.com/academics/grouproject.html">http://www.iamnext.com/academics/grouproject.html</a> (accessed August 20, 2008).</span></p>
        <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="collins-ch08_s03_s03_l01">
            <li>
<em class="emphasis">Draw up a team charter</em>. At the beginning of the project, draw up a team charter (or contract) that includes the goals of the group; ways to ensure that each team member’s ideas are considered and respected; when and where your group will meet; what happens if a team member skips meetings or doesn’t do his or her share of the work; how conflicts will be resolved.</li>
            <li>
<em class="emphasis">Contribute your ideas</em>. Share your ideas with your group; they might be valuable to the group. The worst that could happen is that they won’t be used (which is what would happen if you kept quiet).</li>
            <li>
<em class="emphasis">Never miss a meeting</em>. Pick a weekly meeting time and write it into your schedule as if it were a class. Never skip it. And make your meetings productive.</li>
            <li>
<em class="emphasis">Be considerate of each other</em>. Be patient, listen to everyone, communicate frequently, involve everyone in decision making, don’t think you’re always right, be positive, avoid infighting, build trust.</li>
            <li>
<em class="emphasis">Create a process for resolving conflict</em>. Do this before conflict arises. Set up rules to help the group decide whether the conflict is constructive, whether it’s personal, or whether it arises because someone won’t pull his or her weight. Decide, as a group, how conflict will be handled.</li>
            <li>
<em class="emphasis">Use the strengths of each team member</em>. Some students are good researchers, others are good writers, others have strong problem-solving or computer skills, while others are good at generating ideas. Don’t have your writer do the research and your researcher do the writing. Not only would the team not be using its resources wisely, but two team members will be frustrated because they’re not using their strengths.</li>
            <li>
<em class="emphasis">Don’t do all the work yourself</em>. Work with your team to get the work done. The project output is not as important as the experience of working in a team.</li>
            <li>
<em class="emphasis">Set deadlines</em>. Don’t leave everything to the end; divide up tasks, hold team members accountable, and set intermediary deadlines for each team member to get his or her work done. Work together to be sure the project is in on time and in good shape.</li>

        <h2 class="title editable block">What Does It Take to Lead a Team?</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch08_s03_s04_p01">“Some people are born leaders, some achieve leadership, and some have leadership thrust upon them.” Or so Shakespeare might have said if he were managing a twenty-first-century work team instead of a sixteenth-century theater troupe. At some point in a successful career, whether in business, school, or any other form of organizational work, you may be asked (or assigned) to lead a team. The more successful you are, the more likely you are to receive such an invitation. So, what will you have to do as a leader? What skills will you need?</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch08_s03_s04_p02">Like so many of the questions that we ask in this book, these questions don’t have any simple answers. As for the first question—What does a leader have to do?—we can provide one broad answer: A leader must help members develop the attitudes and behavior that contribute to team success: interdependence, collective responsibility, shared commitment, and so forth.</p>

            <h2 class="title editable block">Influence Team Members and Gain their Trust</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch08_s03_s04_s01_p01">Team leaders must be able to influence their team members. And notice that we say <em class="emphasis">influence</em>: except in unusual circumstances, giving commands and controlling everything directly doesn’t work very well.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-collins-fn08_028">This section is based on David A. Whetten and Kim S. Cameron, <em class="emphasis">Developing Management Skills</em>, 7th ed. (Upper Saddle River, NJ: Pearson Education, 2007), 510–13.</span> As one team of researchers puts it, team leaders are more effective when they work <em class="emphasis">with</em> members rather than <em class="emphasis">on</em> them.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-collins-fn08_029">David A. Whetten and Kim S. Cameron, <em class="emphasis">Developing Management Skills</em>, 7th ed. (Upper Saddle River, NJ: Pearson Education, 2007), 511.</span> Hand in hand with the ability to influence is the ability to gain and keep the <em class="emphasis">trust</em> of team members. People aren’t likely to be influenced by a leader whom they perceive as dishonest or selfishly motivated.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch08_s03_s04_s01_p02">Assuming you were asked to lead a team, there are certain leadership skills and behaviors that would help you influence your team members and build trust. Let’s look at seven of these:</p>
            <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="collins-ch08_s03_s04_s01_l01">
                <li>
<em class="emphasis">Demonstrate integrity</em>. Do what you say you’ll do, and act in accordance with your stated values. Be honest in communicating with members, and follow through on promises.</li>
                <li>
<em class="emphasis">Be clear and consistent</em>. Let members know that you’re certain about what you want, and remember that being clear and consistent reinforces your credibility.</li>
                <li>
<em class="emphasis">Generate positive energy</em>. Be optimistic and compliment team members. Recognize their progress and success.</li>
                <li>
<em class="emphasis">Acknowledge common points of view</em>. Even if you’re about to propose some kind of change, before embarking on a new stage of a project recognize the value of the views that members already hold in common.</li>
                <li>
<em class="emphasis">Manage agreement and disagreement</em>. When members agree with you, focus on your point of view and present it reasonably. When they disagree with you, acknowledge both sides of the issue and support your own with strong, clearly presented evidence.</li>
                <li>
<em class="emphasis">Encourage and coach</em>. Buoy up members when they run into new and uncertain situations and when success depends on their performing at a high level. Give them the information they need and otherwise help them to perform tasks.</li>
                <li>
<em class="emphasis">Share information</em>. Let members know that you’re knowledgeable about team tasks and individual talents. Check with team members regularly to find out what they’re doing and how the job is progressing. Collect information from outside sources, and make sure that it gets to the team members who need it.</li>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Communication by Design</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch08_s04_s01_p01">As the chief designer assigned to the “thin-clam” team at Motorola, Chris Arnholt was responsible for some of the phone’s distinctive physical features, including its sleek aluminum finish and backlit keyboard. In fact, it was he who pushed the company’s engineers and marketers to buck an industry trend toward phones that were getting fatter because of many add-ons such as cameras and stereo speakers. For Arnholt had a vision. He called it “rich minimalism,” and his goal was to help the Motorola cell phone team realize a product that embodied that profile.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch08_s04_s01_p02">But what exactly did Arnholt mean by rich minimalism? “Sometimes,” he admits, “my ideas are tough to communicate,” but as a veteran in his field, he also understands that “design is really about communication.”<span class="footnote" id="fwk-collins-fn08_031">See Adam Lashinsky, “RAZR’s Edge,” <em class="emphasis">Fortune</em>, <em class="emphasis">CNNMoney.com</em>, June 1, 2006, <a class="link" href="http://money.cnn.com/magazines/fortune/fortune_archive/2006/06/12/8379239/index.htm">http://money.cnn.com/magazines/fortune/fortune_archive/2006/06/12/8379239/index.htm</a> (accessed August 22, 2008); Scott D. Anthony, “Motorola’s Bet on the RAZR’s Edge,” <em class="emphasis">HBS Working Knowledge</em>, September 12, 2005, <a class="link" href="http://hbswk.hbs.edu/archive/4992.html">http://hbswk.hbs.edu/archive/4992.html</a> (accessed August 24, 2008).</span> His chief (and ongoing) task, then, was communicating to the cell phone team what he meant by rich minimalism. Ultimately, of course, he had to show them what rich minimalism looked like when it appeared in tangible form in a fashionable new cell phone. In the process, he also had to be sure that the cell phone included certain key benefits that prospective consumers would want. As always, the physical design of the finished product had to be right for its intended market.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch08_s04_s01_p03">We’ll have much more to say about the process of developing new products in <a class="xref" href="collins-ch10#collins-ch10">Chapter 10 "Product Design and Development"</a>. Here, however, let’s simply highlight two points about the way successful companies approach the challenges of new-product design and development (which you will likely recognize from reading the first part of this chapter):</p>
        <ol class="orderedlist editable block" id="collins-ch08_s04_s01_l01">
            <li>In contributing to the new-product design and development process, industrial designers like Chris Arnholt must effectively communicate both ideas and practical specifications.</li>
            <li>The design and development process usually succeeds only when the assigned team integrates input from every relevant area of the organization.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-collins-fn08_032">See Glen L. Urban and John R. Hauser, <em class="emphasis">Design and Marketing of New Products</em>, 2nd ed. (Upper Saddle River, NJ: Prentice Hall, 1993), 173.</span>
</li>
        </ol>
        <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch08_s04_s01_p04">The common denominator in both facets of the process is effective communication. The designer, for example, must communicate not only his vision of the product but also certain specifications for turning it into something concrete. Chris Arnholt sculpted models out of cornstarch and then took them home at night to refashion them according to suggestions made by the product team. Then he’d put his newest ideas on paper and hand the drawings over to another member of his design team, who’d turn them into 3D computer graphics from which other specialists would build plastic models. Without effective communication at every step in this process, it isn’t likely that a group of people with different skills would produce plastic models bearing a practical resemblance to Arnholt’s original drawings. On top of everything else, Arnholt’s responsibility as chief designer required him to communicate his ideas not only about the product’s visual and physical features but also about the production processes and manufacturing requirements for building it.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-collins-fn08_033">See Industrial Designers Society of America (IDSA), “About ID,” <em class="emphasis">IDSA</em>, <a class="link" href="http://www.idsa.org/absolutenm/templates/?a=89&amp;z=23">http://www.idsa.org/absolutenm/templates/?a=89&amp;z=23</a> (accessed September 4, 2008).</span></p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch08_s04_s01_p05">Thus Arnholt’s job—which is to say, his responsibility on the cell phone team—meant that he had to do a lot more than merely design the product. Strictly speaking, the designer’s function is to understand a product from the consumer’s point of view; develop this understanding into a set of ideas and specifications that will satisfy not only consumer needs but producer requirements; and make recommendations through drawings, models, and verbal communications.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-collins-fn08_034">IDSA, Industrial Designers Society of America (IDSA), “About ID,” <em class="emphasis">IDSA</em>, <a class="link" href="http://www.idsa.org/absolutenm/templates/?a=89&amp;z=23">http://www.idsa.org/absolutenm/templates/?a=89&amp;z=23</a> (accessed September 4, 2008).</span> Even our condensed version of the RAZR story, however, indicates that Arnholt’s job was far broader. Why? Because new-product design is an integrative process: contributions must come from all functions within an organization, including <em class="emphasis">operations</em> (which includes research and development, engineering and manufacturing), <em class="emphasis">marketing</em>, <em class="emphasis">management</em>, <em class="emphasis">finance</em>, and <em class="emphasis">accounting</em>.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-collins-fn08_035">See Glen L. Urban and John R. Hauser, <em class="emphasis">Design and Marketing of New Products</em>, 2nd ed. (Upper Saddle River, NJ: Prentice Hall, 1993), 173.</span></p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch08_s04_s01_p06">Our version of the RAZR story has emphasized operations (which includes research and development, engineering, and manufacturing) and touched on the role of marketing (which collects data about consumer needs). Remember, though, that members from several areas of management were recruited for the team. Because the project required considerable investment of Motorola’s capital, finance was certainly involved, and the decision to increase production in late 2004 was based on numbers crunched by the accounting department. At every step, Arnholt’s drawings, specs, and recommendations reflected his collaboration with people from all these functional areas.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch08_s04_s01_p07">As we’ll see in the next section, what all this interactivity amounts to is <em class="emphasis">communication</em>.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-collins-fn08_036">See Glen L. Urban and John R. Hauser, <em class="emphasis">Design and Marketing of New Products</em>, 2nd ed. (Upper Saddle River, NJ: Prentice Hall, 1993), 653.</span> As for what Arnholt meant by rich minimalism, you’ll need to take a look at the picture of the RAZR in <a class="xref" href="collins-ch08_s00#collins-ch08_s00_f01">Figure 8.1 "Motorola RAZR"</a>. Among other things, it means a blue electroluminescent panel and a 22 kHz polyphonic speaker.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">What Is Communication?</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch08_s04_s02_p01">Let’s start with a basic (and quite practical) definition of <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">communication</a><span class="glossdef">Process of transferring information from a sender to a receiver.</span></span> as the process of transferring information from a sender to a receiver. When you call up a classmate to inform him that your Introduction to Financial Accounting class has been canceled, you’re sending information and your classmate is receiving it. When you go to your professor’s Web site to find out the assignment for the next class, your professor is sending information and you’re receiving it. When your boss e-mails you the data you need to complete a sales report and tells you to e-mail the report back to her by 4 o’clock, your boss is sending information and, once again, you’re receiving it; later in the day, the situation will be reversed.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch08_s04_s03_p01">Obviously, you participate in dozens of “informational transfers” every day. (In fact, they take up about 70 percent of your waking hours—80 percent if you have some sort of managerial position.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-collins-fn08_037">Stephen P. Robbins and Timothy A.

Cameron, <em class="emphasis">Developing Management Skills</em>, 7th ed. (Upper Saddle River, NJ: Pearson Education, 2007), 243.</span>) In any case, it wouldn’t make much sense for us to pursue the topic much further without assuming that you’ve gained <em class="emphasis">some</em> experience and mastered <em class="emphasis">some</em> skills in the task of communicating. At the same time, though, we’ll also venture to guess that you’re much more comfortable having casual conversations with friends than writing class assignments or giving speeches in front of classmates. That’s why we’re going to resort to the same plain terms that we used when we discussed the likelihood of your needing teamwork skills in an organizational setting: The question is not whether you’ll need communication skills (both written and verbal). You will. The question is whether you’ll develop the skills to communicate effectively in a variety of organizational situations.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch08_s04_s03_p02">Once again, the numbers back us up.

No matter what your “workstation” happens to be—whether your workplace office or your kitchen table—you’re performing the task of preparing that sales report in an <em class="emphasis">organizational setting</em>. You’re still a sender transferring information to a receiver, but the organizational context of the task requires you to consider different factors for success in communicating effectively (including barriers to success). A report, for example, must be targeted for someone in a specific position and must contain the information necessary to make a specific set of decisions.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-collins-fn08_041">See Michael Netzley and Craig Snow, <em class="emphasis">Guide to Report Writing</em> (Upper Saddle River, NJ: Prentice Hall, 2002), 3–21.</span></p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Communication Flows</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch08_s05_s02_p01">Here’s another way of thinking about communication in an organizational setting. Let’s assume that you and the classmate you called on the phone are on roughly equal footing—you’re both juniors, your grades in the class are about the same, and so forth. Your phone conversation, therefore, is “lateral”: You belong to the same group (your accounting class), and your group activities take place on the same level.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch08_s05_s02_p02">Communication may also flow laterally in organizational settings (as it does between you and your classmate), but more often it flows up or down. Take a look at <a class="xref" href="#collins-ch08_s05_s02_f01">Figure 8.8 "Formal Communication Flows"</a>. If it looks familiar, that’s because we’ve borrowed it from <a class="xref" href="collins-ch06#collins-ch06">Chapter 6 "Managing for Business Success"</a>, where it appeared as the <em class="emphasis">organization chart</em> for the fictional company Notes-4-You.

            <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch08_s05_s02_s01_p01">Naturally, each of these different directional flows has its functions and advantages. Downward communication, for example, is appropriate for giving instructions or directions—telling people what to do. (As a goal of communication, by the way, giving orders isn’t as one-sided as it may seem. One of the things that employees—the receivers—most want to know is: What, exactly, does my job entail?<span class="footnote" id="fwk-collins-fn08_043">Jerald Greenberg and Robert A. Baron, <em class="emphasis">Behavior in Organizations</em>, 9th ed. (Upper Saddle River, NJ: Pearson Education, 2008), 350–51.</span>) Like a sales report, upward communication usually provides managers with information that they need for making decisions, but it’s also the vehicle for new ideas, suggestions, and complaints. Horizontal communication supports efforts to coordinate tasks and otherwise help people work together.</p>

        <div class="section" id="collins-ch08_s05_s02_s02">
            <h2 class="title editable block">Disadvantages of Communication Flows</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch08_s05_s02_s02_p01">And, of course, each type of flow has its disadvantages. As information seeps downward, for instance, it tends to lose some of its original clarity and often becomes distorted or downright wrong. (This is especially true when it’s delivered orally.) In addition, unlike Donald Trump, most people who are responsible for using downward communication don’t like delivering bad news (such as “You’re fired” or, more commonly, “Your job is being phased out”); as a result, bad news—including bad news that happens to be important news—is often ignored or disguised. The same thing may happen when bad news—say, a negative status report—must be sent upward.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch08_s05_s02_s02_p02">Finally, while horizontal flows are valuable for promoting cooperation, they can also be used to engage in conflict—for instance, between two departments competing for the same organizational resources. The problem is especially bad when such horizontal communications breach official upward or downward lines of communication, thus bypassing managers who might be able to resolve the conflict.</p>

Informal communication, for example, can take place either among people within the company (internally) or between insiders and outsiders (externally). By and large, though you can use the same set of tools (memos, reports, phone calls) to communicate in any of these four situations, some tools (team blogs, news releases, supplier Web sites) are useful only in one or two.</p>

Look again at <a class="xref" href="#collins-ch08_s05_s02_f01">Figure 8.8 "Formal Communication Flows"</a>. Because it incorporates the <em class="emphasis">organization chart</em> for Notes-4-You, it shows the company’s lines of authority—what, in <a class="xref" href="collins-ch06#collins-ch06">Chapter 6 "Managing for Business Success"</a>, we called its <em class="emphasis">reporting relationships</em>. Here we can see that the reporting relationships in question consist of <em class="emphasis">upward communication</em> from subordinates to superiors. In reporting to the operations manager, for example, the note-takers’ supervisor communicates upward. Conversely, when the note-takers’ manager needs to give direction to note takers, she will use <em class="emphasis">downward communication</em>. If the note-takers’ manager and the copiers’ manager must get together to prepare a joint report for the operations manager, they’ll engage in <em class="emphasis">lateral communication</em>. In short, an organization’s formal communication network is basically the same thing as its network of reporting relationships and lines of authority.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-collins-fn08_045">See Jerald Greenberg and Robert A.

            <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch08_s05_s03_s02_p01">Every company also has an <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">informal communication network (or grapevine)</a><span class="glossdef">Network that carries information whenever two or more employees get together and start talking about the company and their jobs.</span></span>, which goes to work whenever two or more employees get together and start talking about the company and their jobs. Informal communication can take place just about anywhere (in one person’s cubicle, in the cafeteria, on the golf course) and by just about any means (phone, e-mail, instant messaging, face-to-face conversation).</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch08_s05_s03_s02_p02">Though it’s sometimes called the <em class="emphasis">grapevine</em>, an informal network is an extremely important communication channel. Why? For the simple reason that it’s typically widespread and can rarely be prevented, even if it’s not officially sanctioned by the company—indeed, even when the company tries to discourage or bypass it. Unofficial information crosses virtually every boundary drawn by a firm’s organization chart, reaching out and touching everyone in the organization, and what’s more, it travels a lot faster than official information.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch08_s05_s03_s03_p01">The downside of “unofficial” information should be obvious. Because much of it is communicated orally, it’s likely to get distorted and often degenerates into outright misinformation. Say, for example, that a rumor about layoffs gets started in your workplace. As more than one manager will verify, such rumors can do more damage than the reality. Morale may plummet and productivity won’t be far behind. Valuable employees may abandon ship (needlessly, if the rumors are false).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-collins-fn08_046">See Steven A. Watson, “Sharing Info and Defusing Rumors Helps Keep Staff Motivated During Layoffs,” <em class="emphasis">TechRepublic</em>, June 17, 2003, <a class="link" href="http://articles.techrepublic.com.com/5100-10878_11-5035116.html">http://articles.techrepublic.com.com/5100-10878_11-5035116.html</a> (accessed September 6, 2008).</span></p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch08_s05_s03_s03_p02">And imagine what can happen if informal information gets outside the organization. In the 1970s, Chicago-area McDonald’s outlets found themselves fighting rumors about worms in their hamburgers. Over the years, Coca-Cola has had to fight rumors about terrorists joining its organization, subversive messages concealed in its label, and hyperacidity (false rumors that Coke causes osteoporosis and makes a good pesticide and an equally good spermicide).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-collins-fn08_047">Allan J.

            <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch08_s05_s03_s04_p01">On the upside, savvy managers can tap into the informal network, either to find out what sort of information is influencing employee activities or to circulate more meaningful information, including new ideas as well as corrective information. In any case, managers have to deal with the grapevine, and one manager has compiled a list of suggestions for doing so effectively:<span class="footnote" id="fwk-collins-fn08_048">Charles R. McConnell, “Controlling the Grapevine,” <em class="emphasis">Small Business Toolbox</em>, June 18, 2008, <a class="link" href="http://www.nfib.com/object/IO_37650?_templateId=315">http://www.nfib.com/object/IO_37650?_templateId=315</a> (accessed September 6, 2008).</span></p>
            <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="collins-ch08_s05_s03_s04_l01">
                <li>
<em class="emphasis">Learn to live with it</em>. It’s here to stay.</li>
                <li>
<em class="emphasis">Tune into it</em>. Pay attention to the information that’s circulating and try to learn something from it. Remember: The more you know about grapevine information, the better you can interact with employees (who, in turn, will probably come to regard you as someone who keeps in touch with the things that concern them).</li>
                <li>
<em class="emphasis">Don’t participate in rumors</em>. Resist the temptation to add your two cents’ worth, and don’t make matters worse.</li>
                <li>
<em class="emphasis">Check out what you hear</em>. Because it’s your job to replace bad information with good information, you need to find out what’s really going on.</li>
                <li>
<em class="emphasis">Take advantage of the grapevine</em>. Its only function is to carry information, so there’s no reason why you can’t pump some useful information through it.</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch08_s05_s03_s04_p02">Perhaps most importantly, when alert managers notice that the grapevine is particularly active, they tend to reach a sensible twofold conclusion:</p>
            <ol class="orderedlist editable block" id="collins-ch08_s05_s03_s04_l02">
                <li>The organization’s formal lines of communication aren’t working as well as they should be.</li>
                <li>The best way to minimize informal communication and its potential damage is to provide better formal communication from the outset—or, failing that, to provide whatever formal communication will counteract misinformation as thoroughly as possible.</li>
            </ol>
            <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch08_s05_s03_s04_p03">Let’s go back to our example of a workplace overwhelmed by layoff rumors. In a practical sense, what can a manager—say, the leader of a long-term product-development team—do to provide better communication? One manager suggests at least three specific responses:<span class="footnote" id="fwk-collins-fn08_049">Steven A. Watson, “Sharing Info and Defusing Rumors Helps Keep Staff Motivated During Layoffs,” <em class="emphasis">TechRepublic</em>, June 17, 2003, <a class="link" href="http://articles.techrepublic.com.com/5100-10878_11-5035116.html">http://articles.techrepublic.com.com/5100-10878_11-5035116.html</a> (accessed September 6, 2008).</span></p>
            <ol class="orderedlist editable block" id="collins-ch08_s05_s03_s04_l03">
                <li>Go to your supervisor or another senior manager and try to find out as much as you can about the organization’s real plans.</li>
                <li>Ask a senior manager or a human resources representative to meet with your team and address members’ concerns with accurate feedback.</li>
                <li>Make it a priority to keep channels open—both between yourself and your team members and between team members and the human resources department.</li>
            </ol>
            <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch08_s05_s03_s04_p04">Because actions of this sort send a message, they can legitimately be characterized as a form of formal communication. They also reflect good leadership: Even though the information in this case relates only indirectly to immediate team tasks, you’re sharing information with people who need it, and you’re demonstrating integrity (you’re being honest, and you’re following through on a commitment to the team).</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch08_s05_s04_s01_p01">By <em class="emphasis">barriers</em> we mean anything that prevents people from communicating as effectively as possible. Noise, for example, can be a barrier to communication; if you and other team members are mumbling among yourselves while your team leader is trying to explain task assignments, you’re putting up a barrier to group communication. As a matter of fact, you’re putting up two barriers: In addition to <em class="emphasis">creating noise</em>, you’re <em class="emphasis">failing to listen</em>. About 80 percent of top executives say that learning to listen is the most important skill in getting things done in the workplace,<span class="footnote" id="fwk-collins-fn08_050">John V.

        <h2 class="title editable block">Two Types of Barriers</h2>

        <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch08_s05_s05_p01">As for creating unnecessary verbal noise and failing to listen, we can probably chalk them up to poor communication habits (or maybe the <em class="emphasis">same</em> habit, for as legendary management expert Peter Drucker argues, “Listening is not a skill; it is a discipline. All you have to do is keep your mouth shut”). In the rest of this section, we’ll overlook personal barriers to communication and concentrate instead on two types of barriers that are encountered by groups of people, sometimes large and sometimes small, working toward organizational goals.</p>
        <div class="section" id="collins-ch08_s05_s05_s01">
            <h2 class="title editable block">Cultural Barriers</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch08_s05_s05_s01_p01"><span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Cultural barriers</a><span class="glossdef">Barriers that result from differences among people of different cultures.</span></span>, which are sometimes called cultural filters, are the barriers that result from differences among people of different cultures.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-collins-fn08_051">See Melinda G. Kramer, <em class="emphasis">Business Communication in Context: Principles and Practice</em> (Upper Saddle River, NJ: Prentice Hall, 2001), 87.</span> As we point out in <a class="xref" href="collins-ch07#collins-ch07">Chapter 7 "Recruiting, Motivating, and Keeping Quality Employees"</a>, experts and managers agree that cultural diversity in the workplace can and should be a significant asset: It broadens the perspectives from which groups approach problems, gives them fresh ideas, and sparks their creativity; it also gives organizations an advantage in connecting with diverse customer bases. None of these advantages, though, magically appears simply because workplace diversity increases. To the contrary: As diversity increases, so does the possibility that a group will be composed of people who have different attitudes and different ways of expressing them.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch08_s05_s05_s01_p02">If it hasn’t happened already, for example, one of these days you’ll find yourself having a work-related conversation with a member of the opposite sex. If the conversation doesn’t go as smoothly as you’d expected, there’s a good reason: Men and women in the workplace don’t communicate the same way. According to American linguist Deborah Tannen, men tend to assert their status, to exert confidence, and to regard asking questions as a sign of weakness. Women, in contrast, tend to foster positive interrelationships, to restrain expressions of confidence, and to ask questions with no trouble.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-collins-fn08_052">See Jerald Greenberg and Robert A. Baron, <em class="emphasis">Behavior in Organizations</em>, 9th ed. (Upper Saddle River, NJ: Pearson Education, 2008), 360–61. See Deborah Tannen, <em class="emphasis">Talking 9 to 5: Women and Men at Work</em> (New York: Avon, 1995).</span></p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch08_s05_s05_s01_p03">It really doesn’t matter which “style” (if either) is better suited to making a conversation more productive. Two points, however, are clear:</p>
            <ol class="orderedlist editable block" id="collins-ch08_s05_s05_s01_l01">
                <li>Even if two people of the opposite sex enter a conversation with virtually identical viewpoints, their different styles of expressing themselves might very well present a barrier to their reaching an agreement. Much the same can be said of differences in style arising from other cultural filters, such as ethnicity, education, age, and experience.</li>
                <li>Workplace conversations can be tricky to negotiate, yet there’s no escaping them. Like life in the outside world, observes Tannen, life in the workplace “is a matter of dealing with people…and that means a series of conversations.” That’s also why surveys continue to show that managers regard the ability to communicate face to face as a key factor in an employee’s promotability.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-collins-fn08_053">David A.

            <h2 class="title editable block">Functional Barriers</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch08_s05_s05_s02_p01">Let’s return for a moment to <a class="xref" href="#collins-ch08_s05_s02_f01">Figure 8.8 "Formal Communication Flows"</a>. Recall that when we introduced the organizational structure of Notes-4-You in <a class="xref" href="collins-ch06#collins-ch06">Chapter 6 "Managing for Business Success"</a>, we characterized it as a <em class="emphasis">functional organization</em>—one that groups together people who have comparable skills and perform similar tasks. Note, however, that in setting up this form of organization for our hypothetical company, we found it necessary to insert two layers of management (four functional managers and two job supervisors) between our owner/president and our lowest-level employees. In this respect, our structure shares certain characteristics with another form of organization—<em class="emphasis">divisional</em>, which groups people into units that are more or less self-contained and that are largely accountable for their own performance.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch08_s05_s05_s02_p02">What does all this have to do with barriers to communication? Simply this: The more “divisionalized” an organization becomes, the more likely it will be to encounter communication barriers. Not surprisingly, communication gets more complicated, for the same reason that an organization comes to rely on more levels of management.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-collins-fn08_054">See Jennifer M. George and Gareth R. Jones, <em class="emphasis">Understanding and Managing Organizational Behavior</em>, 5th ed. (Upper Saddle River, NJ: Pearson Education, 2008), 544.</span> Notes-4-You, for instance, needs two supervisors because its note takers don’t do the same work as its copiers. In addition, because their groups don’t perform the same work, the two supervisors don’t call on the same resources from the company’s four functional managers. (Likewise, Notes-4-You also has four functional-area managers because none of them does the same work as any of the others.)</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch08_s05_s05_s02_p03">Officially, then, the operations of the two work groups remain distinct or specialized. At the same time, each group must contribute to the company-wide effort to achieve common goals. Moreover, certain organizational projects, like Motorola’s cell phone project, may require the two groups to work together more closely than usual. When that happens, employees from each of the two groups may find themselves working together on the same team, but even so, one crucial fact remains: Information that one group possesses and the other doesn’t must still be exchanged among team members. It may not be quite as apparent as the <em class="emphasis">cultural diversity</em> among men and women in many workplace situations, but there is in fact a <em class="emphasis">functional diversity</em> at Notes-4-You among note takers and copiers.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-collins-fn08_055">See Anne S.

                <li>The company has assigned team members from different functional areas, notably marketing and operations (which, as at Motorola, includes design, engineering, and production).</li>
                <li>Information (which we’ve characterized as different types of “specs”) must be transferred from function to function, and at the key points where this occurs, we’ve built in communication barriers (symbolized by brick walls).</li>
            </ol>
            <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch08_s05_s05_s02_p05">If, for example, marketing specs called for the new Motorola phone to change colors with the user’s mood, someone in engineering might have to explain the difficulties in designing the software.

            <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch08_s05_s05_s02_p06">Each technical problem—each problem that arises because of differences in team members’ knowledge and expertise—becomes a problem in communication. In addition, communicating as a member of a team obviously requires much more than explaining the limitations of someone else’s professional expertise. Once they’ve surfaced, technical and other problems have to be resolved—a process that will inevitably require even more communication. As we’ve seen in this part of the chapter, improving communication is a top priority for most organizations (for one thing, developing a team-based environment is otherwise impossible), and the ongoing task of improving communication is pretty much the same thing as the ongoing task of overcoming barriers to it.</p>

                    <li>Organizational communication also flows through two different <em class="emphasis">networks</em>. Its <strong class="emphasis bold">formal communication network</strong> consists of all communications that flow along an organization’s official lines of authority. The <strong class="emphasis bold">informal communication network</strong>, sometimes called the <em class="emphasis">grapevine</em>, goes to work whenever two or more employees get together and start talking about the company and their jobs.</li>

<em class="emphasis">Barriers to communication</em> include anything that prevents people from communicating as effectively as possible. Among groups, two types of barriers are common. <em class="emphasis">Cultural barriers</em>, sometimes called <em class="emphasis">cultural filters</em>, are the barriers that result from differences among people of different cultures. <em class="emphasis">Functional barriers</em> arise when communication must flow among individuals or groups who work in different functional areas of an organization.</li>

The skill ranked highest in importance was the use of e-mails, including the ability to adapt messages to different receivers or compose persuasive messages when necessary. The ability to make presentations (with visuals) ranked second in importance. Report writing came next. Given the complexity of report writing, we will not cover this topic here. Instead, we will look at the remaining three forms of communication: e-mail, presentations with visuals, and memos.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Tips for Writing Business E-Mails</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch08_s06_s01_p01">Here are some tips for writing effective e-mail messages:</p>
        <ol class="orderedlist editable block" id="collins-ch08_s06_s01_l01">
            <li>
<em class="emphasis">Distinguish between formal and informal situations</em>. When writing to a coworker with whom you are friends, you can be less formal than when you are writing to your manager or a client.</li>
            <li>
<em class="emphasis">Write a meaningful subject line</em>. Recipients use the subject line to decide whether to open or delete a message, and sometimes where to store it. Write a subject line that describes the content.</li>
            <li>
<em class="emphasis">Keep the message focused and readable</em>. Avoid including multiple messages or requests in one e-mail. Try to focus on only one topic. Use standard capitalization and spelling; none of this “thx 4 ur help 2day ur gr8.”</li>
            <li>
<em class="emphasis">Avoid attachments</em>. Extract the relevant text from a large file and ask the recipient if he or she wants to see the full document.</li>
            <li>
<em class="emphasis">Identify yourself clearly in the first few lines</em>—otherwise your message might be deleted quickly.</li>
            <li>
<em class="emphasis">Be kind. Avoid writing e-mails when you are upset</em>. Always think before you hit the “send” button. Once it’s gone, you can’t get it back. If you’re mad, write the e-mail, but don’t send it. Keep it in your “save” or “draft” folder and reread it the next day.</li>
            <li>
<em class="emphasis">Proofread</em>. Use spell check and read the memo carefully before sending it.</li>
            <li>
<em class="emphasis">Don’t assume privacy</em>. Don’t send anything you wouldn’t want posted on the office bulletin board (with your name on it). Remember, employers can read your e-mails!</li>
            <li>
<em class="emphasis">Respond promptly</em>. Get back quickly to the person who sent you the e-mail. If you’re too busy to answer, let the person know you got the message and will respond as soon as you can.</li>
            <li>
<em class="emphasis">Show respect and restraint</em>. Watch out: Don’t use the “reply to all” button in error. Don’t forward an e-mail before getting permission from the sender.</li>

        <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch08_s06_s02_p01">For some, the thought of making a presentation is traumatic. If you’re one of those people, the best way to get over your fear is to get up and make a presentation. With time, it will get easier, and you might even start enjoying it. As you progress through college, you will have a number of opportunities to make presentations. This is good news—it gives you practice, lets you make your mistakes in a protected environment (before you hit the business world), and allows you to get fairly good at it. Your opportunities to talk in front of a group will multiply once you enter the business world. Throughout your business career, you’ll likely be called on to present reports, address groups at all levels in the organization, represent your company at various events, run committee meetings, lead teams, or make a sales pitch.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-collins-fn08_058">Paul W. Barada, “Confront Your Fears and Communicate,” Monster.com,<a class="link" href="http://career-advice.monster.com/business-communication/Confront-Your-Fears-and-Communicate/home.aspx">http://career-advice.monster.com/business-communication/Confront-Your-Fears-and-Communicate/home.aspx</a> (accessed August 11, 2008).</span> In preparing and delivering your presentation, you can follow a four-step process (plan, prepare, practice, and present) designed by Dale Carnegie, a global training company named after its famed founder.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-collins-fn08_059">“Presentation Tips from Dale Carnegie Training,” Dale Carnegie, <a class="link" href="http://www.erinhoops.ca/LobbyingHandbook/Presentation_Tips.htm">http://www.erinhoops.ca/LobbyingHandbook/Presentation_Tips.htm</a> (accessed August 13, 2008).</span></p>

            <h2 class="title editable block">Plan</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch08_s06_s02_s01_p01">Plan your presentation based on your purpose and the knowledge level and interest of your audience. Use words and concepts your audience can understand, and stay focused. If your audience is knowledgeable about your topic, you can skim over the generalities and delve into the details. On the other hand, if the topic is new to them, you need to move through it slowly. As you plan your presentation, ask yourself these questions: What am I trying to accomplish? Am I trying to educate, inform, motivate, or persuade my audience? What does my audience know about the topic? What do I want them to know? How can I best convey this information to them?</p>

            <h2 class="title editable block">Prepare</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch08_s06_s02_s02_p01">Once you have planned your presentation, you’re ready to prepare. It might be easier to write your presentation if you divide it into three sections: opening, body, close. Your opening should grab your audience’s attention. You can do this by asking a question, telling a relevant story, or even announcing a surprising piece of information. About 5 to 10 percent of your time can be spent on the opening. The body covers the bulk of the material and consumes about 80 to 85 percent of your time. Cover your key points, stay focused, but do not overload your audience. It has been found that an audience can absorb only about four to six points. Your close, which uses about 5 to 10 percent of your time, should leave the audience with a positive impression of you and your presentation. You have lots of choices for your close: You can either summarize your message, or relate your closing remarks to your opening remarks, or do both.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch08_s06_s02_s03_p01">This section should really be called “Practice, Practice, Practice” (and maybe another Practice for emphasis). The saying “practice makes perfect” is definitely true with presentations, especially for beginners. You might want to start off practicing your presentation by yourself, perhaps in front of a mirror. You could even videotape yourself and play it back (that should be fun). As you get the hang of it, ask a friend or a group of friends to listen to and critique your talk. When you rehearse, check your time to see whether it’s what you want. Avoid memorizing your talk, but know it well.</p>

        <div class="section" id="collins-ch08_s06_s02_s04">

            <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch08_s06_s02_s04_p01">Now you’re ready for the big day—it’s time to present. Dress for the part—if it’s a professional talk, dress like a professional. Go early to the location where you’ll present, check out the room, and be sure any equipment you’ll need is there and works. Try to connect with your audience as soon as you start your presentation. Take your time delivering your opening. Act as natural as you can, and try to relax. Slow your speech down, as you’ll likely have a tendency to speed up if you get nervous. Pause before and after your main point for emphasis. If you put brief notes on index cards, avoid reading from the cards. Glance down at them when needed, but then look up at your audience as you speak. Involve your audience in your presentation by asking them questions. Not only will they feel included, but it will help you relax. When you’re close to finishing, let your audience know this (but don’t announce it too early in the talk or your audience might start packing up prematurely). Remember to leave some time for questions and answers.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch08_s06_s02_s05_p01">It’s very common to use visual aids (generally PowerPoint slides) in business presentations. The use of visual aids helps your audience remember your main points and keeps you focused. If you do use PowerPoint slides, follow some simple (but important) rules:<span class="footnote" id="fwk-collins-fn08_060">“Making PowerPoint Slides—Avoiding the Pitfalls of Bad Slides,” <a class="link" href="http://www.iasted.org/conferences/formatting/Presentations-Tips.ppt">http://www.iasted.org/conferences/formatting/Presentations-Tips.ppt</a> (accessed August 13, 2008).</span></p>
            <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="collins-ch08_s06_s02_s05_l01">
                <li>Avoid wordiness: use key words and phrases only.</li>
                <li>Don’t crowd your slide: include at most four to five points per slide.</li>
                <li>Use at least an eighteen-point font (so that it can be seen from the back of the room).</li>
                <li>Use a color font that contrasts with the background (for example, blue font on white background).</li>
                <li>Use graphs rather than just words.</li>
                <li>Proof your slides and use spell check.</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch08_s06_s02_s05_p02">And most important: The PowerPoint slides are background, but you are the show. Avoid turning around and reading the slides. The audience wants to see <em class="emphasis">you</em> talk; they are not interested in seeing the back of your head.</p>

In addition to engaging in classroom discussions of business issues, you’ll be asked to complete a number of written assignments.

            <p class="para" id="collins-ch08_s06_s03_p04">In each assignment, you’ll use the <em class="emphasis">memo format</em>, which is the typical form of written communication used in business.

            <p class="para" id="collins-ch08_s06_s03_p05">Here are a few helpful hints to get you started on the right track:</p>
            <ul class="itemizedlist" id="collins-ch08_s06_s03_l02">
                <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">The format should follow the format of this memo</strong>. Note the <strong class="emphasis bold">guide headings</strong>—“TO,” “FROM,” “DATE,” and “RE” (which, by the way, stands for “regarding” or “reference”). We also include a line across the page to signal the beginning of the body of the memo.</li>
                <li>Keep <strong class="emphasis bold">paragraphs</strong> short and to the point. The trick is being concise yet complete—summarizing effectively. Paragraphs should be single-spaced, flush against the left margin, and separated by a single blank line.</li>
                <li>Accent or highlight <strong class="emphasis bold">major points</strong>. Use underlining, bullets, or bold type for desired effect (taking care not to overdo it).</li>
                <li>Use <em class="emphasis">short </em><strong class="emphasis bold">headings</strong> to distinguish and highlight vital information. Headings keep things organized, provide structure, and make for smooth reading. Headings (and, as appropriate, subheadings) are an absolute <em class="emphasis">must</em>.</li>
                <li>Your <strong class="emphasis bold">title</strong> (the “Re” line) should reflect the contents of your memo: It should let the reader know why he or she should read it. Keep the title short—a phrase of a few words, not a sentence.</li>
                <li>Be persuasive and convincing in your narrative. You have limited space in which to get your <strong class="emphasis bold">key points</strong> across. State your positions clearly. And again, be concise (a memo is not a term paper).</li>
                <li>If you have any additional information in the form of <strong class="emphasis bold">exhibits</strong>—charts, tables, illustrations, and so forth—put them in an <strong class="emphasis bold">attachment</strong>. Label each item “Exhibit 1,” “Exhibit 2,” and the like. Give each one a title, and be sure to reference them in your narrative (“As shown in Exhibit 1, the annual growth rate in sales has dropped from double-digit to single-digit levels”).</li>
                <li>Finally, <em class="emphasis">staple</em> multiple pages for submission. Needless to say, be sure to proofread for correct spelling and punctuation. Don’t scribble in changes by hand: They’re sloppy and leave a bad impression.</li>
            </ul>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Nonverbal Communication</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch08_s06_s04_p01">Sometimes it’s not what you say or how you say it that matters, but what your body language communicates about you and how you feel. When a good friend who’s in a bad mood walks into a room, you don’t need to hear a word from her to know she’s having an awful day. You can read her expression. In doing this, you’re picking up on her <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">nonverbal communication</a><span class="glossdef">“Nonword” messages communicated through facial expressions, posture, gestures, and tone of voice.</span></span>—“nonword” messages communicated through facial expressions, posture, gestures, and tone of voice. People give off nonverbal cues all the time. So what effect do these cues have in the business setting? Quite a bit—these cues are often better at telling you what’s on a person’s mind than what the person actually says. If an employee is meeting with his supervisor and frowns when she makes a statement, the supervisor will conclude that he disapproved of the statement (regardless of what he claims). If two employees are discussing a work-related problem and one starts to fidget, the other will pick this up as disinterest.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch08_s06_s04_p02">Given the possible negative effect that nonverbal cues can have in business situations, how can you improve your body language? The best approach is to become aware of any nonverbal cues you give out, and then work to eliminate them. For example, if you have a habit of frowning when you disapprove of something, recognize this and stop doing it. If the tone of your voice changes when you are angry, try to maintain your voice at a lower pitch.</p>

To complete it, you should go to <a class="link" href="http://www.nikebiz.com/company_overview/timeline">http://www.nikebiz.com/company_overview/timeline</a> to learn about Nike’s history by reviewing the company’s time line.</p>

        <p class="simpara"><strong class="emphasis bold">Scenario</strong></p>
        <p class="para" id="collins-ch08_s07_p03">You’re one of the fortunate college students selected to participate in Nike’s summer internship program. The program is quite competitive, and you still can’t believe that you were chosen. You arrived in Beaverton, Oregon, yesterday morning and have been busy ever since. Last night, you attended a dinner for new interns where you were welcomed to Nike by CEO Mark Parker.</p>
        <p class="para" id="collins-ch08_s07_p04">You were lucky to be sitting next to a personable, well-informed Nike veteran named Simon Pestridge. Pestridge joined Nike about twelve years ago. He was telling you about a past assignment he had as director of marketing for Australia. (You were impressed with his status at Nike, not just because he doesn’t look much older than you, but also because you’ve always wanted to travel to Australia.) The dinner conversation turned to a discussion of the reasons for Nike’s success. Others at the table were giving their opinions on the subject when Pestridge turned to you and said, “As a new intern, give us an outsider’s point of view. Why do you think Nike’s been so successful?” You were about to venture an opinion when Pestridge was called away for a phone call. As he got up, however, he quickly said, “Send me a memo telling me what factors you think have contributed to Nike’s success. Keep it simple. Three factors are plenty.” Though you were relieved to have a little time to think about your answer, you were also a bit nervous about the prospect of writing your first official memo.</p>
        <p class="para" id="collins-ch08_s07_p05">As everyone else headed for the Bo Jackson gym, you went back to your room to think about Pestridge’s question and to figure out how to go about writing your memo. You want to be sure to start by telling him that you enjoyed talking with him. You also need to remind him that you’re responding to his question about three factors in Nike’s success, and must be sure to explain why you believe they’re important. You’ll end by saying that you hope the information is helpful and that he can contact you if he has any further questions.</p>
        <p class="para" id="collins-ch08_s07_p06">So far, so good, but you’re still faced with the toughest part of your task—identifying the three factors that you deem important to Nike’s success. Fortunately, even at Nike there’s always tomorrow to get something done, so you decide to sleep on it and write your memo in the morning.</p>

        <p class="para" id="collins-ch08_s07_p07">You and three other students have been working on a group project all semester in your Introduction to Business class. One of the members of the team did very little work; he failed to attend almost all the meetings, took no responsibility for any of the tasks, didn’t attend the practice session before your presentation, and in general was a real goof-off. But he happens to be friends with two of the team members. You and your other team members have been asked to complete the attached team member evaluation. You want to give the student what he deserves—almost no credit. But your other two team members don’t agree. They argue that it is “unsocial and mean” to tell the truth about this student’s lack of contribution. Instead, they want to report that everyone shared the work equally. The evaluation will be used in determining grades for each team member. Those who contributed more will get a higher grade than those who did not. Prepare an argument that you can advance to the other team members on the ethics of covering for this student. Assuming that your two teammates won’t change their minds, what would you do?</p>
