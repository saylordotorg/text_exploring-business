        <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch09_s00_p01">Mark Tilden used to build robots for NASA to trash on Mars, but after seven years of watching the results of his work meet violent ends forty-six thousand miles from home, he decided to specialize in robots for earthlings. He left the space world for the toy world and teamed up with Wow Wee Toys Ltd. to create “Robosapien,” an intelligent robot with an attitude.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-collins-fn09_001">Wow Wee Toys, “Robosapien: A Fusion of Technology and Personality,” <a class="link" href="http://www.wowwee.com/robosapien/robo1/robomain.html">http://www.wowwee.com/robosapien/robo1/robomain.html</a> (accessed May 21, 2006).</span> The fourteen-inch-tall robot, which is operated by remote control, has great moves: In addition to the required maneuvers (walking forward and backward and turning), he dances, raps, and gives karate chops. He can pick up (fairly small) stuff and even fling it across the room, and he does everything while grunting, belching, and emitting other bodily sounds.</p>

The answer is fairly simple: Though Mark Tilden is an accomplished inventor who has created a clever product, Robosapien wouldn’t be going anywhere without the marketing expertise of Wow Wee (certainly not forward). In this chapter, we’ll look at the ways in which marketing converts product ideas like Robosapien into commercial successes.</p>

    </div>
    <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch09_s01_p01">When you consider the functional areas of business—accounting, finance, management, marketing, and operations—marketing is the one you probably know the most about. After all, as a consumer and target of all sorts of advertising messages, you’ve been on the receiving end of marketing initiatives for most of your life. What you probably don’t appreciate, however, is the extent to which marketing focuses on providing value to the customer. According to the American Marketing Association, <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">marketing</a><span class="glossdef">Set of processes for creating, communicating, and delivering value to customers and for improving customer relationships.</span></span> is a set of processes for creating, communicating, and delivering value to customers and for improving customer relationships.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-collins-fn09_002">American Marketing Association, “Marketing Glossary Dictionary,” <a class="link" href="http://www.marketingpower.com/mg-dictionary.php?">http://www.marketingpower.com/mg-dictionary.php?</a> (accessed May 21, 2006).</span></p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch09_s01_p02">In other words, marketing isn’t just advertising and selling. It includes everything that organizations do to satisfy customer needs:</p>
    <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="collins-ch09_s01_l02">
        <li>Coming up with a product and defining its features and benefits</li>
        <li>Setting its price</li>
        <li>Identifying its target market</li>
        <li>Making potential customers aware of it</li>
        <li>Getting people to buy it</li>
        <li>Delivering it to people who buy it</li>
        <li>Managing relationships with customers after it has been delivered</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch09_s01_p03">Not surprisingly, marketing is a team effort involving everyone in the organization. Think about a typical business—a local movie theater, for example. It’s easy to see how the person who decides what movies to show is involved in marketing: he or she selects the product to be sold. It’s even easier to see how the person who puts ads in the newspaper works in marketing: he or she is in charge of advertising—making people aware of the product and getting them to buy it. But what about the ticket seller and the person behind the counter who gets the popcorn and soda? What about the projectionist? Are they marketing the business? Absolutely: the purpose of every job in the theater is satisfying customer needs, and as we’ve seen, identifying and satisfying customer needs is what marketing is all about.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch09_s01_p04">If everyone is responsible for marketing, can the average organization do without an official marketing department? Not necessarily: most organizations have marketing departments in which individuals are actively involved in some marketing-related activity—product design and development, pricing, promotion, sales, and distribution. As specialists in identifying and satisfying customer needs, members of the marketing department manage—plan, organize, direct, and control—the organization’s overall marketing efforts.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">The Marketing Concept</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch09_s01_s01_p01"><a class="xref" href="#collins-ch09_s01_s01_f01">Figure 9.2 "The Marketing Concept"</a> is designed to remind you that, to achieve business success, you need to do three things:</p>
        <ol class="orderedlist editable block" id="collins-ch09_s01_s01_l01">
            <li>Find out what customers or potential customers need.</li>
            <li>Develop products to meet those needs.</li>
            <li>Engage the entire organization in efforts to satisfy customers.</li>

        </div>
        <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch09_s01_s01_p02">At the same time, you need to achieve organizational goals, such as profitability and growth. This basic philosophy—satisfying customer needs while meeting organizational goals—is called the <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">marketing concept</a><span class="glossdef">Basic philosophy of satisfying customer needs while meeting organizational goals.</span></span>, and when it’s effectively applied, it guides all of an organization’s marketing activities.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch09_s01_s01_p03">The marketing concept puts the customer first: as your most important goal, satisfying the customer must be the goal of everyone in the organization. But this doesn’t mean that you ignore the bottom line; if you want to survive and grow, you need to make some profit. What you’re looking for is the proper balance between the commitments to customer satisfaction and company survival. Consider the case of Medtronic, a manufacturer of medical devices, such as pacemakers and defibrillators. The company boasts more than 50 percent of the market in cardiac devices and is considered the industry standard setter. Everyone in the organization understands that defects are intolerable in products that are designed to keep people alive. Thus, committing employees to the goal of zero defects is vital to both Medtronic’s customer base and its bottom line. “A single quality issue,” explains CEO Arthur D. Collins Jr., “can deep-six a business.”<span class="footnote" id="fwk-collins-fn09_003">Michael Arndt, “High Tech—and Handcrafted,” <em class="emphasis">BusinessWeek Online</em>, July 5, 2004, <a class="link" href="http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/04_27/b3890113_mz018.htm">http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/04_27/b3890113_mz018.htm</a> (accessed May 21, 2006).</span></p>

The challenge is doing it. As you can see in <a class="xref" href="#collins-ch09_s01_s02_f01">Figure 9.3 "Marketing Strategy"</a>, to put the marketing concept into practice, you need a <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">marketing strategy</a><span class="glossdef">Plan for selecting a target market and creating, pricing, promoting, and distributing products that satisfy customers.</span></span>—a plan for performing two tasks:</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch09_s01_s03_p01">As we saw earlier, businesses earn profits by selling goods or providing services. It would be nice if everybody in the marketplace was interested in your product, but if you tried to sell it to everybody, you’d spread your resources too thin. You need to identify a specific group of consumers who should be particularly interested in your product, who would have access to it, and who have the means to buy it. This group is your <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">target market</a><span class="glossdef">Specific group of customers who should be interested in your product, have access to it, and have the means to buy it.</span></span>, and you’ll aim your marketing efforts at its members.</p>

            <h2 class="title editable block">Identifying Your Market</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch09_s01_s03_s01_p01">How do marketers identify target markets? First, they usually identify the overall market for their product—the individuals or organizations that need a product and are able to buy it. As <a class="xref" href="#collins-ch09_s01_s02_f01">Figure 9.3 "Marketing Strategy"</a> shows, this market can include either or both of two groups:</p>
            <ol class="orderedlist editable block" id="collins-ch09_s01_s03_s01_l01">
                <li>A <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">consumer market</a><span class="glossdef">Buyers who want a product for personal use.</span></span>—buyers who want the product for personal use</li>

            </ol>
            <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch09_s01_s03_s01_p02">You might focus on only one market or both. A farmer, for example, might sell blueberries to individuals on the consumer market and, on the industrial market, to bakeries that will use them to make muffins and pies.</p>

            <h2 class="title editable block">Segmenting the Market</h2>

            <h2 class="title editable block">Demographic Segmentation</h2>

            <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch09_s01_s03_s03_p01"><span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Demographic segmentation</a><span class="glossdef">Process of dividing the market into groups based on such variables as age and income.</span></span> divides the market into groups based on such variables as age, marital status, gender, ethnic background, income, occupation, and education. Age, for example, will be of interest to marketers who develop products for children, retailers who cater to teenagers, colleges that recruit students, and assisted-living facilities that promote services among the elderly. The wedding industry, which markets goods and services to singles who will probably get married in the near future, is interested in trends in marital status. Gender and ethnic background are important to TV networks in targeting different audiences. Lifetime Television for Women targets female viewers; Spike TV targets men; Telemundo networks target Hispanic viewers. If you’re selling yachts, you’ll want to find people with lots of money; so income is an important variable. If you’re the publisher of <em class="emphasis">Nurses</em> magazine, you want to reach people in the nursing profession. When Hyundai offers recent (and upcoming) college graduates the opportunity to buy a new car with no money down, the company’s marketers have segmented the market according to education level.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-collins-fn09_004">Hyundai Motor America, “Special Programs: College Graduate Program,” <a class="link" href="http://www.hyundaiusa.com/financing/specialoffers/collegegraduate.aspx">http://www.hyundaiusa.com/financing/specialoffers/collegegraduate.aspx</a> (accessed May 21, 2006).</span></p>

Climate is crucial for many products: try selling snow shovels in Hawaii or above-ground pools in Alaska. Consumer tastes also vary by region. That’s why McDonald’s caters to regional preferences, offering a breakfast of Spam and rice in Hawaii, tacos in Arizona, and lobster rolls in Massachusetts.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-collins-fn09_005">“McDonald’s Test Markets Spam,” <em class="emphasis">Pacific Business News</em>, June 11, 2002, <a class="link" href="http://www.bizjournals.com/pacific/stories/2002/06/10/daily22.html">http://www.bizjournals.com/pacific/stories/2002/06/10/daily22.html</a> (accessed May 21, 2006).</span> Outside the United States, menus diverge even more widely (you can get seaweed burgers in Japan).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-collins-fn09_006">“The Super McDonalds,” <em class="emphasis">Halfbakery</em>, <a class="link" href="http://www.halfbakery.com/idea/The_20Super_20McDonalds">http://www.halfbakery.com/idea/The_20Super_20McDonalds</a> (accessed May 21, 2006).</span></p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch09_s01_s03_s04_p02">Likewise, differences between urban and suburban life can influence product selection. As exhilarating as urban life can be, for example, it’s a hassle to parallel park on crowded city streets. Thus, Toyota engineers have developed a product especially for city dwellers (at least in Japan). The Japanese version of the Prius, Toyota’s hybrid gas-electric car, can automatically parallel park itself. Using computer software and a rear-mounted camera, the parking system measures the spot, turns the steering wheel, and swings the car into the space (making the driver—who just sits there—look like a master of urban survival skills).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-collins-fn09_007">“Coolest Inventions 2003: Parking-Space Invader,” <em class="emphasis">Time</em> (Online Edition), <a class="link" href="http://www.time.com/time/2003/inventions/invprius.html">http://www.time.com/time/2003/inventions/invprius.html</a> (accessed May 21, 2006).</span></p>

Companies selling technology-based products might segment the market according to different levels of receptiveness to technology. They could rely on a segmentation scale developed by Forrester Research that divides consumers into two camps: <em class="emphasis">technology optimists</em>, who embrace new technology, and <em class="emphasis">technology pessimists</em>, who are indifferent, anxious, or downright hostile when it comes to technology.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-collins-fn09_008">Rob Rubin and William Bluestein, “Applying Technographics,” Forrester Research, <a class="link" href="http://www.forester.com/ER/Marketing/0,1503,84,FF.html">http://www.forester.com/ER/Marketing/0,1503,84,FF.html</a> (accessed May 21, 2006).</span></p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch09_s01_s03_s05_p02">Some companies segment consumers according to <em class="emphasis">user status</em>, distinguishing among nonusers, potential users, first-time users, and regular users of a product. Depending on the product, they can then target specific groups, such as first-time users. Credit-card companies use this approach when they offer promotional gifts to college students in order to induce them to get their first card. Once they start using it, they’ll probably be segmented according to usage. “Heavy users” who pay their bills on time will likely get increased credit lines.</p>

If you prefer to sit on your couch and watch TV, you might show up on the radar screen of a TiVo provider. If you’re compulsive or a risk taker, you might catch the attention of a gambling casino.

            <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch09_s01_s03_s07_p01">Typically, marketers determine target markets by combining, or “clustering,” segmenting criteria. What characteristics does General Motors look for in marketing the Hummer H2? Two demographic variables come to mind: sex and age. Buyers are likely to be males ranging in age from about thirty to fifty-five. Because the Hummer can go off-road and performs well on rugged terrain, geography could also be a factor. Income—a socioeconomic factor—is clearly important: Hummers are expensive to buy, maintain, and run. As for psychographics, potential Hummer owners could be people who value prestige and the material rewards of success. (Given the vehicle’s low gas mileage, we’d have to assume that most of them aren’t particularly concerned about the environment.) Finally, it would help to know what other vehicles they own; Ferrari owners might be worth targeting.</p>

    <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch09_s02_p02">The goal is to develop and implement a marketing strategy that combines these four elements. To see how this process works, let’s look at Wow Wee Toys’ marketing program for Robosapien.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-collins-fn09_009">Information in this section was obtained through an interview with the director of marketing at Wow Wee Toys Ltd. conducted on July 15, 2004.</span></p>
    <div class="section" id="collins-ch09_s02_s01">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Developing a Product</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch09_s02_s01_p01">The development of Robosapien was a bit unusual for a company that was already active in its market. Generally, product ideas come from people within the company who understand its customers’ needs. Internal engineers are then challenged to design the product. In the case of Robosapien, however, the creator, Mark Tilden, had conceived and designed the product before joining Wow Wee Toys. The company gave him the opportunity to develop the product for commercial purposes, and Tilden was brought on board to oversee the development of Robosapien into a product that satisfied Wow Wee’s commercial needs.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch09_s02_s01_p02">Robosapien is not a “kid’s toy,” though kids certainly love its playful personality. It’s a home-entertainment product that appeals to a broad audience—children, young adults, older adults, and even the elderly. It’s a big gift item, and it has developed a following of techies and hackers who take it apart, tinker with it, and even retrofit it with such features as cameras and ice skates. In fact, Tilden wanted the robot to be customizable; that’s why he insisted that its internal parts be screwed together rather than soldered.</p>

    <div class="section" id="collins-ch09_s02_s02">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Conducting Marketing Research</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch09_s02_s02_p01">Before settling on a strategy for Robosapien, the marketers at Wow Wee did some homework. First, to zero in on their target market, they had to find out what various people thought of the product. More precisely, they needed answers to questions like the following:</p>
        <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="collins-ch09_s02_s02_l01">
            <li>Who are our potential customers? What are they like?</li>
            <li>Do people like Robosapien? What gets them excited about it? What don’t they like? What would they change?</li>
            <li>How much are they willing to pay for Robosapien?</li>
            <li>Where will they probably go to buy the product?</li>
            <li>How should it be promoted? How can we distinguish it from competing products?</li>
            <li>Will enough people buy Robosapien to return a reasonable profit?</li>
            <li>Should we go ahead and launch the product?</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch09_s02_s02_p02">The last question would be left up to Wow Wee management, but, given the size of the investment needed to bring Robosapien to market, Wow Wee couldn’t afford to make the wrong decision. Ultimately, the company was able to make an informed decision because its marketing team provided answers to all the other questions. They got these answers through <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">marketing research</a><span class="glossdef">Process of collecting and analyzing data that’s relevant to a specific marketing situation.</span></span>—the process of collecting and analyzing the data that are relevant to a specific marketing situation.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch09_s02_s02_p03">This data had to be collected in a systematic way. Market research seeks two types of data:</p>
        <ol class="orderedlist editable block" id="collins-ch09_s02_s02_l02">
            <li>Marketers generally begin by looking at <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">secondary data</a><span class="glossdef">Information used in marketing decisions that has already been collected for other purposes.</span></span>—information already collected, whether by the company or by others, that pertains to the target market.</li>
            <li>Then, with secondary data in hand, they’re prepared to collect <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">primary data</a><span class="glossdef">Newly collected marketing information that addresses specific questions about the target market.</span></span>—newly collected information that addresses specific questions.</li>
        </ol>
        <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch09_s02_s02_p04">You can get secondary data from inside or outside the organization. Internally available data includes sales reports and other information on customers. External data can come from a number of sources. The U.S. Census Bureau, for example, posts demographic information on American households (such as age, income, education, and number of members), both for the country as a whole and for specific geographic areas. You can also find out whether an area is growing or declining.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch09_s02_s02_p05">Population data helped Wow Wee estimate the size of its potential U.S. target market. Other secondary data helped the firm assess the size of foreign markets in regions around the world, such as Europe, the Middle East, Latin America, Asia, and the Pacific Rim. This data positioned the company to sell Robosapien in eighty-five countries, including Canada, England, France, Germany, South Africa, Australia, New Zealand, Hong Kong, and Japan.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch09_s02_s02_p06">Using secondary data that are already available (and free) is a lot easier than collecting your own information. Unfortunately, however, secondary data didn’t answer all the questions that Wow Wee was asking in this particular situation. To get these answers, the marketing team had to conduct primary research: they had to work directly with members of their target market. It’s a challenging process. First, they had to decide exactly <em class="emphasis">what</em> they wanted to know. Then they had to determine <em class="emphasis">whom</em> to ask. Finally, they had to pick the best <em class="emphasis">methods</em> for gathering information.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch09_s02_s02_p07">We know what they wanted to know—we’ve already listed the questions they asked themselves. As for whom to talk to, they randomly selected representatives from their target market. Now, they could have used a variety of tools for collecting information from these people, each of which has its advantages and disadvantages. To understand the marketing-research process fully, we need to describe the most common of these tools:</p>
        <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="collins-ch09_s02_s02_l03">
            <li>
<em class="emphasis">Surveys</em>. Sometimes marketers mail questionnaires to members of the target market. In Wow Wee’s case, the questionnaire could have included photos of Robosapien. It’s an effective way to reach people, but the process is time consuming and the response rate is generally low. Phoning people also takes a lot of time, but a good percentage of people tend to respond. Unfortunately, you can’t show them the product. Online surveys are easier to answer and get better response rates, and the site can link to pictures or even videos of Robosapien.</li>
            <li>
<em class="emphasis">Personal interviews</em>. Though time consuming, personal interviews not only let you talk with real people but also let you demonstrate Robosapien. You can also clarify answers and ask open-ended questions.</li>
            <li>
<em class="emphasis">Focus groups</em>. With a <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">focus group</a><span class="glossdef">Group of individuals brought together for the purpose of asking them questions about a product or marketing strategy.</span></span>, you can bring together a group of individuals (perhaps six to ten) and ask them questions. A trained moderator can explain the purpose of the group and lead the discussion. If sessions are run effectively, you can come away with valuable information about customer responses to both your product and your marketing strategy.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch09_s02_s02_p08">Wow Wee used focus groups and personal interviews because both approaches had the advantage of allowing people to interact with Robosapien. In particular, focus-group sessions provided valuable opinions about the product, proposed pricing, distribution methods, and promotion strategies. Management was pleased with the feedback and confident that the product would succeed.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch09_s02_s02_p09">Researching your target market is necessary before you launch a new product. But the benefits of marketing research don’t extend merely to brand-new products. Companies also use it when they’re deciding whether or not to refine an existing product or develop a new marketing strategy for an existing product. Kellogg’s, for example, conducted online surveys to get responses to a variation on its Pop-Tarts brand—namely, Pop-Tarts filled with a mixture of traditional fruit filling and yogurt. Marketers had picked out four possible names for the product and wanted to know which one kids and mothers liked best. They also wanted to know what they thought of the product and its packaging. Both mothers and kids liked the new Pop-Tarts (though for different reasons) and its packaging, and the winning name was “Pop-Tarts Yogurt Blasts.” The online survey of 175 mothers and their children was conducted in one weekend by an outside marketing research group.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Branding</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch09_s02_s03_p01">Armed with positive feedback from their research efforts, the Wow Wee team was ready for the next step: informing buyers—both consumers and retailers—about their product. They needed a <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">brand</a><span class="glossdef">Word, letter, sound, or symbol that differentiates a product from similar products on the market.</span></span>—some word, letter, sound, or symbol that would differentiate their product from similar products on the market. They chose the brand name <em class="emphasis">Robosapien</em>, hoping that people would get the connection between <em class="emphasis">homo sapiens</em> (the human species) and <em class="emphasis">Robosapien</em> (the company’s coinage for its new robot “species”). To prevent other companies from coming out with their own “Robosapiens,” they took out a <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">trademark</a><span class="glossdef">Word, symbol, or other mark used to identify and legally protect a product from being copied.</span></span> by registering the name with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch09_s02_s03_p02">Though this approach—giving a unique brand name to a particular product—is a bit unusual, it isn’t unprecedented. Mattel, for example, established a separate brand for Barbie, and Anheuser-Busch sells beer under the brand name Budweiser. Note, however, that the more common approach, which is taken by such companies as Microsoft, Dell, and Apple, calls for marketing all the products made by a company under the company’s brand name.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-collins-fn09_010">“2002 Global Brands Scoreboard,” <em class="emphasis">BusinessWeek Online</em>, August 5, 2002, <a class="link" href="http://bwnt.businessweek.com/brand/2002/index.asp">http://bwnt.businessweek.com/brand/2002/index.asp</a> (accessed May 21, 2006).</span></p>

            <h2 class="title editable block">Branding Strategies</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch09_s02_s03_s01_p01">Companies can adopt one of three major strategies for branding a product:</p>
            <ol class="orderedlist editable block" id="collins-ch09_s02_s03_s01_l01">
                <li>With <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">private branding</a><span class="glossdef">Product made by a manufacturer and sold to a retailer who in turn resells it under its own name.</span></span> (or <em class="emphasis">private labeling</em>), a company makes a product and sells it to a retailer who in turn resells it under its own name. A soft-drink maker, for example, might make cola for Wal-Mart to sell as its Sam’s Choice Cola house brand.</li>
                <li>With <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">generic branding</a><span class="glossdef">Product with no branding information attached to it except a description of its contents.</span></span>, the maker attaches no branding information to a product except a description of its contents. Customers are often given a choice between a brand-name prescription drug or a cheaper generic drug with a similar chemical makeup.</li>
            </ol>

            <ol class="orderedlist editable block" id="collins-ch09_s02_s03_s01_l02" start="3">
                <li>With <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">manufacturer branding</a><span class="glossdef">Branding strategy in which a manufacturer sells one or more products under its own brand names.</span></span>, a company sells one or more products under its own brand names. Adopting a <em class="emphasis">multiproduct-branding</em> approach, it sells all its products under one brand name (generally the company name). Using a <em class="emphasis">multibranding</em> approach, it will assign different brand names to different products. Campbell’s Soup, which markets all its soups under the company’s name, uses the multiproduct-branding approach. Automakers generally use multibranding. Ford, for example, markets to a wide range of potential customers by offering cars under various brand names (Ford, Lincoln, Mercury, Mazda, Volvo, Jaguar, Land Rover, and Aston Martin).</li>
            </ol>
        </div>
        <div class="section" id="collins-ch09_s02_s03_s02">
            <h2 class="title editable block">Building Brand Equity</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch09_s02_s03_s02_p01">Wow Wee went with the multibranding approach, deciding to market Robosapien under the robot’s own brand name. Was this a good choice? The answer depends, at least in part, on how the product sells. If customers don’t like Robosapien, its failure won’t reflect badly on Wow Wee’s other products. On the other hand, people might like Robosapien but have no reason to associate it with other Wow Wee products. In this case, Wow Wee wouldn’t gain much from its <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">brand equity</a><span class="glossdef">Value of a brand generated by a favorable consumer experience with a product.</span></span>—any added value generated by favorable consumer experiences with Robosapien. To get a better idea of how valuable brand equity is, think for a moment about the effect of the name <em class="emphasis">Dell</em> on a product. When you have a positive experience with a Dell product—say, a desktop PC or a laptop—you come away with a positive opinion of the entire Dell product <em class="emphasis">line</em> and will probably buy more Dell products. Over time, you may even develop <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">brand loyalty</a><span class="glossdef">Consumer preference for a particular brand that develops over time based on satisfaction with a company’s products.</span></span>: you may prefer—or even insist on—Dell products. Not surprisingly, brand loyalty can be extremely valuable to a company. Because of customer loyalty, the value of the Coca-Cola brand (whose brand equity has survived such fiascos as New Coke) is estimated at more than $67 billion.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-collins-fn09_011">Diane Brady et al., “Cult Brands,” <em class="emphasis">Business Week</em>, August 2, 2004, 65–71.</span></p>

    <div class="section" id="collins-ch09_s02_s04">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Packaging and Labeling</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch09_s02_s04_p01"><span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Packaging</a><span class="glossdef">Container that holds a product and can influence a consumer’s decision to buy or pass it up.</span></span>—the container that holds your product—can influence a consumer’s decision to buy a product or pass it up. Packaging gives customers a glimpse of the product, and it should be designed to attract their attention. <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Labeling</a><span class="glossdef">Information on the package of a product that identifies the product and provides details of the package contents.</span></span>—what you say about the product on your packaging—not only identifies the product but also provides information on the package contents: who made it and where or what risks are associated with it (such as being unsuitable for small children).</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch09_s02_s04_p02">How has Wow Wee handled the packaging and labeling of Robosapien? The robot, as we know, is fourteen inches tall, and it’s almost as wide. It’s also fairly heavy (about seven pounds), and because it’s made out of plastic and has movable parts, it’s breakable. The easiest, and least expensive, way of packaging it would be to put it in a square box of heavy cardboard and pad it with Styrofoam. This arrangement would not only protect the product from damage during shipping but also make the package easy to store. Unfortunately, it would also eliminate any customer contact with the product inside the box (such as seeing what it looks like and what it’s made of). Wow Wee, therefore, packages Robosapien in a container that’s curved to his shape and has a clear plastic front that allows people to see the whole robot. It’s protected during shipping because it’s wired to the box. Why did Wow Wee go to this much trouble and expense? Like so many makers of so many products, it has to market the product while it’s still in the box. Because he’s in a custom-shaped see-through package, you tend to notice Robosapien (who seems to be looking at you) while you’re walking down the aisle of the store.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch09_s02_s04_p03">Meanwhile, the labeling on the package details some of the robot’s attributes. The name is highlighted in big letters above the descriptive tagline “A fusion of technology and personality.” On the sides and back of the package are pictures of the robot in action with such captions as “Dynamic Robotics with Attitude” and “Awesome Sounds, Robo-Speech &amp; Lights.” These colorful descriptions are conceived to entice the consumer to make a purchase because its product features will satisfy some need or want.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch09_s02_s04_p04">Packaging can serve many purposes. The purpose of the Robosapien package is to attract your attention to the product’s features. For other products, packaging serves a more functional purpose. Nabisco, for example, packages some of its tastiest snacks—Oreos, Chips Ahoy, and Cheese Nips—in “100 Calorie Packs” that deliver exactly one hundred calories per package.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-collins-fn09_012">“Nabisco Introduces 100 Calorie Packs as a Way to Count Calories When Reaching for a Snack,” <em class="emphasis">Packaging Digest</em>, July 12, 2004, <a class="link" href="http://www.packagingdigest.com">http://www.packagingdigest.com</a> (accessed May 21, 2006).</span> Thus, the packaging itself makes life simpler for people who are keeping track of calories (and reminds them of how many cookies they can eat without exceeding one hundred calories).</p>

    <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch09_s03_p01">The second of the four Ps in the marketing mix is price. Pricing a product involves a certain amount of trial and error because there are so many factors to consider. If you price too high, a lot of people simply won’t buy your product. Or you might find yourself facing competition from some other supplier that thinks it can beat your price. On the other hand, if you price too low, you might not make enough profit to stay in business. So how do you decide on a price? Let’s look at several pricing options that were available to those marketers at Wow Wee who were responsible for pricing Robosapien. We’ll begin by discussing two strategies that are particularly applicable to products that are being newly introduced.</p>
    <div class="section" id="collins-ch09_s03_s01">
        <h2 class="title editable block">New Product Pricing Strategies</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch09_s03_s01_p01">Right now, Robosapien has little direct competition in its product category. True, there are some “toy” robots available, but they’re not nearly as sophisticated. Sony makes a pet dog robot called Aibo, but its price tag of $1,800 is really high. Even higher up the price-point scale is the $3,600 iRobi robot made by the Korean company Yujin Robotics to entertain kids and even teach them foreign languages. Parents can also monitor kids’ interactions with the robot through its own video-camera eyes; in fact, they can even use the robot itself to relay video messages telling kids to shut it off and go to sleep.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-collins-fn09_013">Cliff Edwards, “Ready to Buy a Home Robot?” <em class="emphasis">Business Week</em>, July 19, 2004, 84–90.</span></p>
        <div class="section" id="collins-ch09_s03_s01_s01">
            <h2 class="title editable block">Skimming and Penetration Pricing</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch09_s03_s01_s01_p01">Because Wow Wee is introducing an innovative product in an emerging market with few direct competitors, it might consider one of two pricing strategies:</p>
            <ol class="orderedlist editable block" id="collins-ch09_s03_s01_s01_l01">
                <li>With <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">skimming pricing</a><span class="glossdef">Pricing strategy in which a seller generates early profits by starting off charging the highest price that customers will pay.</span></span>, Wow Wee would start off with the highest price that keenly interested customers would pay. This approach would generate early profits, but when competition enters—and it will, because healthy profits can be made in the market—Wow Wee would have to lower its price.</li>
                <li>Using <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">penetration pricing</a><span class="glossdef">Pricing strategy in which the seller charges a low price on a new product to discourage competition and gain market share.</span></span>, Wow Wee would initially charge a low price, both to discourage competition and to grab a sizable share of the market. This strategy might give the company some competitive breathing room (potential competitors won’t be attracted to low prices and modest profits). Over time, as its growing market discourages competition, Wow Wee can push up its prices.</li>
            </ol>

    </div>
    <div class="section" id="collins-ch09_s03_s02">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Other Pricing Strategies</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch09_s03_s02_p01">In their search for the best price level, Wow Wee’s marketing managers could consider a variety of other approaches, such as <em class="emphasis">cost-based pricing, demand-based pricing, target costing, odd-even pricing</em>, and <em class="emphasis">prestige pricing</em>. Any of these methods could be used not only to set an initial price but also to establish long-term pricing levels.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch09_s03_s02_p02">Before we examine these strategies, let’s pause for a moment to think about the pricing decisions that you have to make if you’re selling goods for resale by retailers. Most of us think of price as the amount that we—consumers—pay for a product. But when a manufacturer (such as Wow Wee) sells goods to retailers, the price it gets is <em class="emphasis">not</em> what we the consumers will pay for the product. In fact, it’s a lot less.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch09_s03_s02_p03">Here’s an example. Say you buy a shirt at a store in the mall for $40. The shirt was probably sold to the retailer by the manufacturer for $20. The retailer then marks up the shirt by 100 percent, or $20, to cover its costs and to make a profit. The $20 paid to the manufacturer plus the $20 markup results in a $40 sales price to the consumer.</p>
        <div class="section" id="collins-ch09_s03_s02_s01">
            <h2 class="title editable block">Cost-Based Pricing</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch09_s03_s02_s01_p01">Using <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">cost-based pricing</a><span class="glossdef">Pricing strategy that bases the selling price of a product on its cost plus a reasonable profit.</span></span>, Wow Wee’s accountants would figure out how much it costs to make Robosapien and then set a price by adding a profit to the cost. If, for example, it cost $40 to make the robot, Wow Wee could add on $10 for profit and charge retailers $50.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="section" id="collins-ch09_s03_s02_s02">
            <h2 class="title editable block">Demand-Based Pricing</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch09_s03_s02_s02_p01">Let’s say that Wow Wee learns through market research how much people are willing to pay for Robosapien. Following a <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">demand-based pricing</a><span class="glossdef">Pricing strategy that bases the price of a product on how much people are willing to pay for it.</span></span> approach, it will use this information to set the price that it charges retailers. If consumers are willing to pay $120 retail, Wow Wee will charge retailers a price that will allow retailers to sell the product for $120. What would that price be? Here’s how we would arrive at it: $120 consumer selling price minus a $60 markup by retailers means that Wow Wee can charge retailers $60.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="section" id="collins-ch09_s03_s02_s03">
            <h2 class="title editable block">Target Costing</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch09_s03_s02_s03_p01">With <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">target costing</a><span class="glossdef">Pricing strategy that determines how much to invest in a product by figuring out how much customers will pay and subtracting an amount for profit.</span></span>, you work backward. You figure out (again using research findings) how much consumers are willing to pay for a product. You then subtract the retailer’s profit. From this price—the selling price to the retailer—you subtract an amount to cover your profit. This process should tell you how much you can spend to make the product. For example, Wow Wee determines that it can sell Robosapien to retailers for $70. The company decides that it wants to make $15 profit on each robot. Thus, Wow Wee can spend $55 on the product ($70 selling price to the retailer minus $15 profit means that the company can spend $55 to make each robot).</p>
        </div>
        <div class="section" id="collins-ch09_s03_s02_s04">
            <h2 class="title editable block">Prestige Pricing</h2>

            <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch09_s03_s02_s04_p01">Some people associate a high price with high quality—and, in fact, there generally is a correlation. Thus, some companies adopt a <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">prestige-pricing</a><span class="glossdef">Practice of setting a price artificially high to foster the impression that it is a product of high quality.</span></span> approach—setting prices artificially high to foster the impression that they’re offering a high-quality product. Competitors are reluctant to lower their prices because it would suggest that they’re lower-quality products. Let’s say that Wow Wee finds some amazing production method that allows it to produce Robosapien at a fraction of its current cost. It could pass the savings on by cutting the price, but it might be reluctant to do so: What if consumers equate low cost with poor quality?</p>

        <div class="section" id="collins-ch09_s03_s02_s05">
            <h2 class="title editable block">Odd-Even Pricing</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch09_s03_s02_s05_p01">Do you think $9.99 sounds cheaper than $10? If you do, you’re part of the reason that companies sometimes use <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">odd-even pricing</a><span class="glossdef">Practice of pricing products a few cents (or dollars) under an even number.</span></span>—pricing products a few cents (or dollars) under an even number.

        <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch09_s04_s01_p01">Companies must decide how they will distribute their products. Will they sell directly to customers (perhaps over the Internet)?

        <div class="section" id="collins-ch09_s04_s01_s01">
            <h2 class="title editable block">Selling Directly to Customers</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch09_s04_s01_s01_p01">Many businesses, especially small ones and those just starting up, sell directly to customers. Michael Dell, for example, started out selling computers from his dorm room. Tom First and Tom Story began operations at Nantucket Nectars by peddling home-brewed fruit drinks to boaters in Nantucket Harbor. Most service companies sell directly to their customers; it’s impossible to give a haircut, fit contact lenses, mow a lawn, or repair a car through an intermediary. Many business-to-business sales take place through direct contact between producer and buyer. Toyota, for instance, buys components directly from suppliers.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch09_s04_s01_s01_p02">The Internet has greatly expanded the number of companies using direct distribution, either as their only distribution channel or as an additional means of selling. Dell sells only online, while Adidas and Apple Computer sell both on Web sites and in stores. The eBay online auction site has become the channel of choice for countless small businesses. The advantage of this approach is a certain degree of control over prices and selling activities: you don’t have to depend on or pay an intermediary. On the other hand, you must commit your own resources to the selling process, and that strategy isn’t appropriate for all businesses. It would hardly be practical for Wow Wee to sell directly to individual consumers scattered around the world.</p>

        <div class="section" id="collins-ch09_s04_s01_s02">
            <h2 class="title editable block">Selling through Retailers</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch09_s04_s01_s02_p01"><span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Retailers</a><span class="glossdef">Intermediaries who buy goods from producers and sell them to consumers.</span></span> buy goods from producers and sell them to consumers, whether in stores, by phone, through direct mailings, or over the Internet. Best Buy, for example, buys Robosapiens from Wow Wee and sells them to customers in its stores. Moreover, it promotes Robosapiens to its customers and furnishes technical information and assistance. Each Best Buy outlet features a special display at which customers can examine Robosapien and even try it out. On the other hand, selling through retailers means giving up some control over pricing and promotion, and the wholesale price you get from a retailer, who has to have room to mark up a retail price, is substantially lower than you’d get if you sold directly to consumers.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="section" id="collins-ch09_s04_s01_s03">
            <h2 class="title editable block">Selling through Wholesalers</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch09_s04_s01_s03_p01">Selling through retailers works fine if you’re dealing with only a few stores (or chains). But what if you produce a product—bandages—that you need to sell through thousands of stores, including pharmacies, food stores, and discount stores. You’ll also want to sell to hospitals, day-care centers, and even college health centers. In this case, you’d be committing an immense portion of your resources to the selling process. Besides, buyers like the ones you need don’t want to deal directly with you. Imagine a chain like CVS Pharmacy negotiating sales transactions with the maker of every single product that it carries in its stores. CVS deals with <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">wholesalers</a><span class="glossdef">Intermediaries who buy goods from suppliers and sell them to businesses that will either resell or use them.</span></span> (sometimes called <em class="emphasis">distributors</em>): intermediaries who buy goods from suppliers and sell them to businesses that will either resell or use them. Likewise, you’d sell your bandages to a wholesaler of health care products, which would, in turn, sell them both to businesses like CVS, Kmart, and Giant Supermarkets and to institutions, such as hospitals and college health care centers.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch09_s04_s01_s03_p02">The wholesaler doesn’t provide this service for free. Here’s how it works. Let’s say that CVS is willing to pay $2 a box for your bandages. If you go through a wholesaler, you’ll probably get only $1.50 a box. In other words, you’d make $0.50 less on each box sold. Your <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">profit margin</a><span class="glossdef">Amount that a company earns on each unit sold.</span></span>—the amount you earn on each box—would therefore be less.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch09_s04_s01_s03_p03">While selling through wholesalers will cut into your profit margins, the practice has several advantages. For one thing, wholesalers make it their business to find the best outlets for the goods in which they specialize. They’re often equipped to warehouse goods for suppliers and to transport them from the suppliers’ plants to the point of final sale. These advantages would appeal to Wow Wee. If it sold Robosapiens to just a few retailers, it wouldn’t need to go through a distributor. However, the company needs wholesalers to supply an expanding base of retailers who want to carry the product.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch09_s04_s01_s03_p04">Finally, intermediaries, such as wholesalers, can make the distribution channel more cost-effective. Look, for example, at <a class="xref" href="#collins-ch09_s04_s01_s03_f01">Figure 9.9 "What an Intermediary Can Do"</a>. Because every contact between a producer and a consumer incurs costs, the more contacts in the process (panel <em class="emphasis">a</em>), the higher the overall costs to consumers. The presence of an intermediary substantially reduces the total number of contacts (panel <em class="emphasis">b</em>).</p>

It would be convenient if they’ve already been sold and only needed to be shipped to customers, but business-to-business (B2B) transactions don’t always work out this way. More often, there’s a time lag between manufacture and delivery. During this period, the robots must be stored somewhere. If Wow Wee has to store a large volume over an extended period (perhaps a month or two right before the holiday season), it will keep unsold robots in a <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">storage warehouse</a><span class="glossdef">Building used for the temporary storage of goods.</span></span>.

        <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch09_s04_s03_p01">There are several ways to transport goods from manufacturing facilities to resellers or customers—trucks, trains, planes, ships, and even pipelines. Companies select the best mode (or combination of modes) by considering several factors, including cost, speed, match of transport mode to type of good, dependability, and accessibility. The choice usually involves trade-offs. Planes, for example, are generally faster but cost more than other modes. Sending goods by cargo ship or barge is inexpensive but very slow (and out of the question if you want to send something from Massachusetts to Chicago). Railroads are moderately priced, generally accessible, and faster than ships but slower than planes. They’re particularly appropriate for some types of goods, such as coal, grain, and bulky items (such as heavy equipment and cars). Pipelines are fine if your product happens to be petroleum or natural gas. Trucks, though fairly expensive, work for most goods and can go just about anywhere in a reasonable amount of time.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Creating an Effective Distribution Network: The Supply Chain</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch09_s04_s04_p01">Before we go on to the final component in the marketing mix—<em class="emphasis">promotion</em>—let’s review the elements that we’ve discussed so far: product, price, and place. As we’ve seen, to be competitive, companies must produce quality products, sell them at reasonable prices, and make them available to customers at the right place at the right time. To accomplish these three tasks, they must work with a network of other firms, both those that supply them with materials and services and those that deliver and sell their products. To better understand the links that must be forged to create an effective network, let’s look at the steps that the candy maker Just Born takes to produce and deliver more than one billion Marshmallow Peeps each year to customers throughout the world. Each day, the company engages in the following process:</p>
        <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="collins-ch09_s04_s04_l01">
            <li>Purchasing managers buy raw materials from suppliers (sugar and other ingredients used to make marshmallow, food coloring, and so forth).</li>
            <li>Other operations managers transform these raw materials, or ingredients, into 4.2 million Marshmallow Peeps every day.</li>
            <li>Operations managers in shipping send completed packages to a warehouse where they’re stored for later distribution.</li>
            <li>Operations managers at the warehouse forward packaged Marshmallow Peeps to dealers around the world.</li>
            <li>Retail dealers sell the Marshmallow Peeps to customers.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch09_s04_s04_p02">This process requires considerable cooperation, not only among individuals in the organization but also between Just Born and its suppliers and dealers. Raw-materials suppliers, for instance, must work closely with Just Born purchasing managers, who must, in turn, work with operations managers in manufacturing at Just Born itself. People in manufacturing have to work with operations managers in the warehouse, who have to work with retail dealers, who have to work with their customers.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch09_s04_s04_p03">If all the people involved in each of these steps worked independently, the process of turning raw materials into finished Marshmallow Peeps and selling them to customers would be inefficient (to say the least). However, when everyone works in a coordinated manner, all parties benefit. Just Born can make a higher-quality product at a lower cost because it knows that it’s going to get cooperation from suppliers whose livelihood, after all, depends on the success of customers like Just Born: suppliers can operate more efficiently because they can predict the demand for their products (such as sugar and food coloring). At the other end of the chain, dealers can operate efficiently because they can depend on Just Born to deliver a quality product on time. The real beneficiary is ultimately the end user, or customer: because the process that delivers the product is efficient, its costs are minimized and its quality is optimized. The customer, in other words, gets a higher-quality product at a lower price.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch09_s04_s04_s01_p02">Managing your supply chain can be difficult, particularly if your company has large seasonal fluctuations.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-collins-fn09_020">Simone Kaplan, “Easter in November, Christmas in July,” <em class="emphasis">CIO Magazine</em>, November 1, 2001, <a class="link" href="http://www.cio.com/archive/110101/easter.html">http://www.cio.com/archive/110101/easter.html</a> (accessed May 21, 2006).</span> This is certainly true at Just Born. Even though it has a Marshmallow Peep for every season (heart Peeps for Valentine’s Day, spooky Peeps for Halloween, patriotic Peeps for July Fourth, and so on), the biggest problem rests with the standard yellow Marshmallow Peep that provides a major spike in sales each spring. Without careful supply chain management, there would be either too many or two few yellow Marshmallow Peeps—both big problems. To reduce the likelihood of either situation, the manager of the company’s supply chain works to ensure that all members of the chain work together throughout the busy production season, which begins each fall. Suppliers promise to deliver large quantities of ingredients, workers recognize that they will be busy through February, and dealers get their orders in early. Each member of the chain depends on the others to meet a mutually shared goal: getting the right quantity of yellow Marshmallow Peeps to customers at the right time.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch09_s04_s04_s01_p03">But what if a company has multiple sales spikes (and lulls)? What effect does this pattern have on its supply chain? Consider Domino’s Pizza. Have you ever thought about what it takes to ensure that a piping-hot pizza will arrive at your door on Super Bowl Sunday (Domino’s busiest day of the year)? What about on the average weekend? How about when the weather’s bad and you just don’t want to go out? Clearly, Domino needs a finely tuned supply chain to stay on top of demand. Each year, the company sells about four hundred million pizzas (more than one pizza for every man, woman, and child in the United States). Its suppliers help to make this volume possible by providing the company with about one hundred fifty million pounds of cheese and toppings. Drivers do their part by logging nine million miles a week (the equivalent of 37.5 round trips to the moon every week).</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch09_s04_s04_s01_p04">How are these activities managed? Dominos relies on a software system that uses historical data to forecast demand by store; determines, orders, and adjusts supplies; fills staffing needs according to expected sales levels; and facilitates the smooth flow of accurate information among members of the chain. All this coordination is directed at a single goal—satisfying the largest possible number of end users.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-collins-fn09_021">Domino’s Pizza LLC, “About Domino’s Pizza,” <a class="link" href="http://www.dominos.com">http://www.dominos.com</a> (accessed May 21, 2006).</span></p>

A company must also persuade consumers to buy its products, rather than those of its competitors, and the key to achieving this goal is delivering the most value.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch09_s04_s04_s03_p01">Today’s consumers can choose from a huge array of products offered at a range of prices through a variety of suppliers. So how do they decide which product to buy? Most people buy the product that gives them the highest value, and they usually determine value by considering the three factors that many marketers call the <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">customer value triad</a><span class="glossdef">Three factors that customers consider in determining the value of a product: quality, service, and price.</span></span>: <em class="emphasis">quality, service</em>, and <em class="emphasis">price</em>.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-collins-fn09_022">Philip Kotler, <em class="emphasis">Marketing Management</em>, 11th ed. (Upper Saddle River, NJ: Prentice Hall, 2003), 11.</span> In short, consumers tend to select the product that provides the best combination of these factors.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch09_s04_s04_s03_p02">To deliver high customer value, a company must monitor and improve its <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">value chain</a><span class="glossdef">Entire range of activities involved in delivering value to customers.</span></span>—the entire range of activities involved in delivering value to customers.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-collins-fn09_023">The concept of the value chain was first analyzed by Michael Porter in <em class="emphasis">Competitive Advantage: Creating and Sustaining Superior Performance</em> (New York: The Free Press, 1985).</span> Some of these activities arise in the process of supply chain management—obtaining raw materials, manufacturing products, getting finished goods to customers. Others take place outside the supply chain, particularly those associated with marketing and selling products and with providing customer support. In addition, companies need to find ways of creating value by improving the internal operations—procurement, research and development, human resource management, and financial management—that support their primary value-chain activities.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch09_s04_s04_s03_p03">The idea is fairly simple: by focusing on the interrelated links in its value chain, a company can increase product quality, provide better service, and cut prices.

These are all tools for telling people about your product and persuading potential customers, whether consumers or organizational users, to buy it. Before deciding on an appropriate promotional strategy, you should consider a few questions:</p>
    <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="collins-ch09_s05_l02">
        <li>What’s the main purpose of the promotion? Am I simply trying to make people aware of my product, or am I trying to get people to buy it right now? Am I trying to develop long-term customers? Am I trying to promote my company’s image?</li>
        <li>What’s my target market? What’s the best way to reach it?</li>
        <li>Which product features (quality, price, service, availability, innovativeness) should I emphasize? How does my product differ from those of competitors?</li>

    <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch09_s05_p02">To promote a product, you need to imprint a clear image of it in the minds of your target audience. What do you think of, for instance, when you hear “Ritz-Carlton”? What about “Motel 6”? They’re both hotel chains, but the names certainly conjure up different images. Both have been quite successful in the hospitality industry, but they project very different images to appeal to different clienteles. The differences are evident in their promotions. The Ritz-Carlton Web site describes “luxury hotels” and promises that the chain provides “the finest personal service and facilities throughout the world.” Motel 6, by contrast, characterizes its facilities as “discount hotels” and assures you that you’ll pay “discount hotel rates.”</p>

The cofounders of Nantucket Nectars found radio ads particularly effective. Rather than pay professionals, they produced their own ads themselves. (Actually, they just got on the radio and started rambling about their product or their lives or anything else that seemed interesting at the time.)<span class="footnote" id="fwk-collins-fn09_026">Nantucket Allserve, Inc., “Nantucket Nectars from the Beginning,” <a class="link" href="http://www.juiceguys.com">http://www.juiceguys.com</a> (accessed May 21, 2006).</span> As unprofessional as they sounded, the ads worked, and the business grew.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Marketing Robosapien</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch09_s05_s02_p01">Now let’s look more closely at the strategy that Wow Wee pursued in marketing Robosapien in the United States. The company’s goal was ambitious: to promote the robot as a must-have item for kids of all ages. As we know, Wow Wee intended to position Robosapien as a home-entertainment product, not as a toy. In spring 2004, therefore, the company rolled out the product at Best Buy, which sells consumer electronics, computers, entertainment software, and appliances. As marketers had hoped, the robot caught the attention of consumers shopping for TV sets, DVD players, home and car audio equipment, music, movies, and games. Its $99 price tag was also consistent with Best Buy’s storewide pricing. Indeed, the retail price was a little lower than the prices of other merchandise, and that fact was an important asset: shoppers were willing to treat Robosapien as an <em class="emphasis">impulse item</em>—something extra to pick up as a gift or as a special present for children, as long as the price wasn’t too high.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch09_s05_s02_p02">Meanwhile, Robosapien was also getting lots of free publicity. Stories appeared in newspapers and magazines around the world, including the <em class="emphasis">New York Times</em>, the <em class="emphasis">Times of London, Time</em> magazine, and <em class="emphasis">National Parenting</em> magazine. Commentators on <em class="emphasis">The Today Show, The Early Show</em>, CNN, ABC News, and FOX News remarked on it; it was even the talk of the prestigious New York Toys Fair. It garnered numerous awards, and experts predicted that it would be a hot item for the holidays.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch09_s05_s02_p03">At Wow Wee, Marketing Director Amy Weltman (who had already had a big hit with the Rubik’s Cube) developed a gala New York event to showcase the product. From mid to late August, actors dressed in six-foot robot costumes roamed the streets of Manhattan, while the fourteen-inch version of Robosapien performed in venues ranging from Grand Central Station to city bars. Everything was recorded, and film clips were sent to TV stations.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch09_s05_s02_p04">Then the stage was set for expansion into other stores. Macy’s ran special promotions, floating a twenty-four-foot cold-air robot balloon from its rooftop and lining its windows with armies of Robosapiens. Wow Wee trained salespeople to operate the product so that they could help customers during in-store demonstrations. Other retailers, including The Sharper Image, Spencer’s, and Toys “R” Us, carried Robosapien, as did e-retailers such as Amazon.com. The product was also rolled out (with the same marketing flair) in Europe and Asia.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch09_s05_s02_p05">When national advertising hit in September, all the pieces of the marketing campaign came together—publicity, sales promotion, personal selling, and advertising. Wow Wee ramped up production to meet anticipated fourth-quarter demand and waited to see whether Robosapien would live up to commercial expectations.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Customer-Relationship Management</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch09_s05_s03_p01">Customers are the most important asset that any business has. Without enough good customers, no company can survive, and to survive, a firm must not only attract new customers, but, perhaps more importantly, it must also hold on to its current customers. Why? Because repeat customers are more profitable. It’s estimated that it costs as much as six times more to attract and sell to a new customer than to an existing one.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-collins-fn09_031">Randall B. Bean, “We’re Not There Yet,” <em class="emphasis">Direct Marketing Business Intelligence</em>, September 30, 1999, <a class="link" href="http://directmag.com/mag/marketing_not_yet/index.html">http://directmag.com/mag/marketing_not_yet/index.html</a> (accessed May 21, 2006).</span> Repeat customers also tend to spend more, and they’re much more likely to recommend you to other people.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch09_s05_s03_p02">Retaining customers is the purpose of <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">customer-relationship management</a><span class="glossdef">Strategy for retaining customers by gathering information about them, understanding them, and treating them well.</span></span>—a marketing strategy that focuses on using information about current customers to nurture and maintain strong relationships with them. The underlying theory is fairly basic: to keep customers happy, you treat them well, give them what they want, listen to them, reward them with discounts and other loyalty incentives, and deal effectively with their complaints.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch09_s05_s03_p03">Take Harrah’s, which operates more than forty casinos in three countries. Each year, it sponsors the World Series of Poker with a top prize of $5 million. Harrah’s gains some brand recognition when the twenty-two-hour event is televised on ESPN, but the real benefit derives from the information cards filled out by the thirteen thousand entrants who put up from $50 to $10,000 for a chance to walk away with $5 million. Data from these cards is fed into Harrah’s database, and almost immediately every entrant starts getting special attention, including party invitations, free entertainment tickets, and room discounts. The program is all part of Harrah’s strategy for targeting serious gamers and recognizing them as its best customers.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-collins-fn09_032">Stephane Fitch, “Stacking the Deck: Harrah’s Wants Your Money,” <em class="emphasis">Forbes.com</em>, July 5, 2004, <a class="link" href="http://www.forbes.com/business/forbes/2004/0705/132.html">http://www.forbes.com/business/forbes/2004/0705/132.html</a> (accessed May 21, 2006).</span></p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch09_s05_s03_p04">Sheraton Hotels uses a softer approach to entice return customers. Sensing that its resorts needed both a new look and a new strategy for attracting repeat customers, Sheraton launched its “Year of the Bed” campaign: in addition to replacing all its old beds with luxurious new mattresses and coverings, it issued a “service promise guarantee”—a policy that any guest who’s dissatisfied with his or her Sheraton stay will be compensated. The program also calls for a customer-satisfaction survey and discount offers, both designed to keep the hotel chain in touch with its customers.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch09_s05_s03_p05">Another advantage of keeping in touch with customers is the opportunity to offer them additional products. Amazon.com is a master at this strategy. When you make your first purchase at Amazon.com, you’re also making a lifelong “friend”—one who will suggest (based on what you’ve bought before) other things that you might like to buy. Because Amazon.com continually updates its data on your preferences, the company gets better at making suggestions. Now that the Internet firm has expanded past books, Amazon.com can draw on its huge database to promote a vast range of products, and shopping for a variety of products at Amazon.com appeals to people who value time above all else.</p>

            <h2 class="title editable block">Permission versus Interruption Marketing</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch09_s05_s03_s01_p01">Underlying Amazon.com’s success in communicating with customers is the fact that customers have given the company permission to contact them. Companies that ask for customers’ cooperation engage in <em class="emphasis">permission marketing</em>.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-collins-fn09_033">Seth Godin, <em class="emphasis">Permission Marketing: Turning Strangers into Friends, and Friends into Customers</em> (New York: Simon &amp; Schuster, 1999), 40–52.</span> The big advantage is focusing on an audience of people who have already shown an interest in what they have to offer. Compare this approach with <em class="emphasis">mass marketing</em>—the practice of sending out messages to a vast audience of anonymous people. If you advertise on TV, you’re hoping that people will listen, even though you’re interrupting them; that’s why some marketers call such standard approaches <em class="emphasis">interruption marketing</em>.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-collins-fn09_034">Anthony Bianco, “The Vanishing Mass Market,” <em class="emphasis">Business Week</em>, July 12, 2004, 61–68.</span> Remember, however, that permission marketing isn’t free. Because winning and keeping customers means giving them incentives, Amazon.com offers its returning customers free shipping, while Harrah’s lets high rollers sleep and eat free (or at a deep discount). Customer-relations management and permission marketing have actually been around for a long time. But recent advances in technology, especially the Internet, now allow companies to practice these approaches in more cost-effective ways.</p>

    </div>
    <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch09_s06_p01">Did you play with LEGO blocks when you were a kid? Almost everyone did. They were a big deal. Store shelves were stacked with boxes of plastic bricks, wheels, and windows, plus packages containing just the pieces you needed to make something special, like a LEGO helicopter. McDonald’s put LEGO sets in Happy Meals. If you walk down a toy-store aisle today, you’ll still find LEGOs. Now, however, they’re shelved alongside Game Boys, Xboxes, Pokémon characters, and other playthings that appeal to contemporary kids. Like these products, they’re more sophisticated. They’re often tied in with state-of-the-art products—movies like <em class="emphasis">Star Wars, Spider-Man</em>, and <em class="emphasis">Harry Potter</em>. Nowadays, even the instructions are complicated, because the product has changed: LEGOs are no longer marketed as a toy that encourages free-form play. Sadly, LEGO sales declined drastically in the early 2000s. Laments the company’s annual report, “2003 was a very disappointing year for LEGO Company.” Net sales fell by 26 percent, resulting in a loss in earnings for the year and significant decline in market share. LEGO now plans to drop many of its recent initiatives and focus on its classic LEGO brick products.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-collins-fn09_035">LEGO Group, <em class="emphasis">Annual Report 2003</em>, <a class="link" href="http://www.lego.com/eng/info/default.asp?page=annualreport">http://www.lego.com/eng/info/default.asp?page=annualreport</a> (accessed May 21, 2006).</span></p>

In theory, it’s a lot like the life cycle that people go through. Once it’s developed, a new product is <em class="emphasis">introduced</em> to the market. With any success at all, it begins to <em class="emphasis">grow</em>, attracting more buyers. At some point, the market stabilizes, and the product becomes <em class="emphasis">mature</em>.

    <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch09_s06_p03">This is a simplified version of the cycle. There are lots of exceptions to the product life-cycle rules. For one thing, most products never make it past the introduction stage; they die an early death. Second, some products (like some people) avoid premature demise by reinventing themselves. LEGO has been reinventing itself for the last fifteen years, launching new products in an effort to recover its customer base and overcome a series of financial crises. Unfortunately, this strategy has been unsuccessful. The introduction of new products and the resulting costs “have not produced the desired results. In some cases,” admits the company, “new products have even cannibalized on the sales of LEGO Company’s core products and thus eroded earnings.”<span class="footnote" id="fwk-collins-fn09_037">LEGO Group, <em class="emphasis">Annual Report 2003</em>, <a class="link" href="http://www.lego.com/eng/info/default.asp?page=annualreport">http://www.lego.com/eng/info/default.asp?page=annualreport</a> (accessed May 21, 2006).</span></p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Life Cycle and the Changing Marketing Mix</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch09_s06_s01_p01">As a product or brand moves through its life cycle, the company that markets it will shift its marketing-mix strategies. Let’s see how the mix might be changed at each stage.</p>
        <div class="section" id="collins-ch09_s06_s01_s01">
            <h2 class="title editable block">Introduction</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch09_s06_s01_s01_p01">At this stage, most companies invest in advertising to make consumers aware of a product. If it faces only limited competition, it might use a skimming-pricing approach. Typically, because it will sell only a relatively small quantity of the product, it will distribute through just a few channels. Because sales are low while advertising and other costs are high, the company tends to lose money during this stage.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="section" id="collins-ch09_s06_s01_s02">
            <h2 class="title editable block">Growth</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch09_s06_s01_s02_p01">As the company focuses on building sales, which are increasing rapidly at this stage, its advertising costs will go up. If competition appears, it may respond by lowering prices and distributing through multiple distribution channels. With sales going up and costs going down, the product becomes more profitable.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="section" id="collins-ch09_s06_s01_s03">
            <h2 class="title editable block">Maturity</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch09_s06_s01_s03_p01">If a product survives the growth stage, it will probably remain in the maturity stage for a long time. Sales still grow, though at a decreasing rate, and will eventually stabilize. Advertising will be used to differentiate the product from competition. Price wars may occur, but profits will be good because sales volume will remain high. As the product becomes outdated, the company may make changes in keeping with changing consumer preferences.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="section" id="collins-ch09_s06_s01_s04">
            <h2 class="title editable block">Decline</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch09_s06_s01_s04_p01">LEGO is now in this stage: demand has declined as more innovative products absorb the attention of kids. Price competition has become more intense, and profits are harder to come by; in fact, in some years they’ve turned into losses. As we’ve seen, LEGO has tried to revitalize the product, but ultimately the company may have to give up and pull the product from the market.</p>

    </div>
    <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch09_s07_p01">By and large, managers can control the four Ps of the marketing mix: they can decide which products to offer, what prices to charge for them, how to distribute them, and how to reach target audiences. Unfortunately, there are other forces at work in the marketing world—forces over which marketers have much less control. These forces make up a company’s <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">external marketing environment</a><span class="glossdef">Factors external to the firm that present threats and opportunities and that require shifts in marketing plans.</span></span>, which, as you can see in <a class="xref" href="#collins-ch09_s07_f01">Figure 9.15 "The Marketing Environment"</a>, we can divide into five sets of factors:</p>

        <li>Political and regulatory</li>
        <li>Economic</li>

    </div>
    <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch09_s07_p02">These factors—and changes in them—present both threats and opportunities that require shifts in marketing plans. To spot trends and other signals that conditions may be in flux, marketers must continually monitor the environment in which their companies operate. To get a better idea of how they affect a firm’s marketing activities, let’s look at each of the five areas of the external environment.</p>
    <div class="section" id="collins-ch09_s07_s01">
        <h2 class="title editable block">The Political and Regulatory Environment</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch09_s07_s01_p01">Federal, state, and local bodies can set rules or restrictions on the conduct of businesses. The purpose of regulation is to protect both consumers and businesses. Businesses favor some regulations (such as patent laws) while chafing under others (such as restrictions on advertising). The tobacco industry, for example, has had to learn to live with a federal ban on TV and radio advertising. More recently, many companies in the food industry have expressed unhappiness over regulations requiring the labeling of trans-fat content. The broadcasting industry is increasingly concerned about fines being imposed by the Federal Communications Commission for offenses against “standards of decency.” The loudest outcry probably came from telemarketers in response to the establishment of “do-not-call” registries.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch09_s07_s01_p02">All these actions occasioned changes in the marketing strategies of affected companies. Tobacco companies rerouted advertising dollars from TV to print media. Food companies reduced trans-fat levels and began targeting health-conscious consumers. Talent coordinators posted red flags next to the names of Janet Jackson (of the now-famous malfunctioning costume) and other performers. The telemarketing industry fired workers and scrambled to reinvent its entire business model.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section" id="collins-ch09_s07_s02">
        <h2 class="title editable block">The Economic Environment</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch09_s07_s02_p01">Every day, marketing managers face a barrage of economic news. They must digest it, assess its impact, and alter marketing plans accordingly. Sometimes (but not recently), the news is cause for optimism—the economy’s improving, unemployment’s declining, consumer confidence is up. At other times (like today), the news makes them nervous—we’re in a recession, industrial production is down, jobless claims are rising,consumer confidence has plummeted, credit is hard to get. Naturally, business thrives when the economy is growing, employment is full, and prices are stable. Marketing products is easier because consumers are willing to buy. On the other hand, when the economy is slowing (or stalled) and unemployment is rising, people have less money to spend, and the marketer’s job is harder.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch09_s07_s02_p02">Then there’s inflation, which pushes interest rates upward. If you’re trying to sell cars, you know that people facing higher interest rates aren’t so anxious to take out car loans. Sales will slip, and to counteract the anticipated slowdown, you might have to add generous rebates to your promotional plans.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch09_s07_s02_p03">Moreover, if you operate in foreign markets, you can’t focus on solely domestic economic conditions: you have to monitor the economy in every region where you do business. For example, if you’re the marketing director for a U.S. company whose goods are manufactured in Asia and sold in South America, you’ll need to know as much as you can about the economies on three continents. For one thing, you’ll have to pay particular attention to fluctuations in exchange rates, because changes will affect both your sales and your profits.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section" id="collins-ch09_s07_s03">
        <h2 class="title editable block">The Competitive Environment</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch09_s07_s03_p01">Imagine playing tennis without watching what your opponent was doing. Marketers who don’t pay attention to their competitors are playing a losing game. In particular, they need to monitor the activities of two groups of competitors: the makers of competing brands and the makers of substitute products. Coke and Pepsi, for instance, are brand competitors who have engaged in the so-called “cola wars” for decades. Each tries to capture market share by convincing people that its soft drinks are better. Because neither wants to lose share to the other, they tend to resort to similar tactics. In summer 2004, both companies came out with nearly identical new colas boasting half the sugar, half the calories, and half the carbohydrates of regular colas. Coke called its product Coke C2, while Pepsi named its competing brand PepsiEdge. Both companies targeted cola drinkers who want the flavor of a regular soda but fewer calories. (By the way, both products failed and were taken off the market.)</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch09_s07_s03_p02">Meanwhile, Coke and Pepsi have to watch Nantucket Nectars, whose fruit drinks are substitute products. What if Nantucket Nectars managed to get its drinks into the soda machines at more fast-food restaurants? How would Coke and Pepsi respond? What if Nantucket Nectars, which markets an ice tea with caffeine, introduced an ice tea drink with mega amounts of caffeine? Would marketers at Coke and Pepsi take action? What if Nantucket Nectars launched a marketing campaign promoting the health benefits of fruit drinks over soda? Would Coke and Pepsi reply with campaigns of their own? Would they respond by introducing new noncola products?</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section" id="collins-ch09_s07_s04">
        <h2 class="title editable block">The Technological Environment</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch09_s07_s04_p01">When’s the last time you went to Blockbuster to rent a VHS tape of a new movie? If you had trouble finding it, that’s because DVDs are in and videotapes are out. Videotape makers who were monitoring technological trends in the industry would probably have taken steps to keep up (go into DVDs) or otherwise protect themselves from losses (maybe even getting out of the market). In addition to making old products obsolete, technological advances create new products. Where would we be without the cell phone, digital cameras, instant messaging, personal digital assistants, LASIK surgery, and global positioning systems?</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch09_s07_s04_p02">New technologies also transform the marketing mix in another important way: they alter the way companies market their products. Consider the revolutionary changes brought about by the Internet, which offers marketers a new medium for promoting and selling a vast range of goods and services. Marketers must keep abreast of technological advances and adapt their strategies, both to take advantage of the opportunities and to ward off threats.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section" id="collins-ch09_s07_s05">
        <h2 class="title editable block">The Social and Cultural Environment</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch09_s07_s05_p01">Marketers also have to stay tuned to social and cultural factors that can affect sales. The values and attitudes of American consumers are in a state of almost constant flux; what’s cool one year is out of style the next. Think about the clothes you wore five years ago: would you wear them today? A lot of people wouldn’t—they’re the wrong style, the wrong fit, the wrong material, the wrong color, or just plain wrong. Now put yourself in the place of a marketer for a clothing company that targets teenagers and young adults. You wouldn’t survive if you tried to sell the same styles every year. As we said at the outset of this chapter, the key to successful marketing is meeting the needs of customers. This means knowing what they want right now, not last year.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch09_s07_s05_p02">Here’s another illustration. The last few decades have witnessed monumental shifts in the makeup of the American workforce. The number of women at all levels has increased significantly, the workforce has become more diverse, and telecommuting is more common. More people place more importance on balancing their work lives with the rest of their lives, and fewer people are willing to sacrifice their health to the demands of hectic work schedules. With these changes have come new marketing opportunities. As women spend more time at work, the traditional duties of the “homemaker” have shifted to day-care centers, nannies, house-cleaning services, and (for those who can afford them) child chauffeurs, birthday-party coordinators, and even family-photo assemblers.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-collins-fn09_038">Sandra Tsing Loh, “Nannyhood and Apple Pie,” <em class="emphasis">The Atlantic</em>, October 1, 2003, 122–23.</span> The number of gyms has mushroomed, the selection of home office furniture has expanded, and McDonald’s has bowed to the wishes of the health-conscious by eliminating its “super-size” option.</p>
        <div class="section" id="collins-ch09_s07_s05_s01">
            <h2 class="title editable block">Generation Gaps</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch09_s07_s05_s01_p01">Clothiers who target teens and young adults (such as Gap and Abercrombie &amp; Fitch) must estimate the size of both current and future audiences. So must companies that specialize in products aimed at customers in other age brackets—say, young children or retirees. Marketers pay particular attention to population shifts because they can have dramatic effects on a consumer base, either increasing or decreasing the number of potential customers.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch09_s07_s05_s01_p02">Marketers tend to assign most Americans born in the last sixty years to one of three groups: the <em class="emphasis">baby-boom generation</em> (those born between 1946 and 1964), <em class="emphasis">Generation</em> X (1965 to 1975), and <em class="emphasis">Generation</em> Y—also known as “echo baby boomers” or “millenniums” (1976 to 2001).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-collins-fn09_039">Jessica R. Sincavage, “The Labor Force and Unemployment: Three Generations of Change,” <em class="emphasis">Monthly Labor Review</em>, June 2004, 34.</span> In addition to age, members of each group tend to share common experiences, values, and attitudes that stay with them as they mature. These values and attitudes have a profound effect on both the products they want and the marketing efforts designed to sell products to them. Let’s look a little more closely at some of the defining characteristics of each group.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="section" id="collins-ch09_s07_s05_s02">
            <h2 class="title editable block">Baby Boomers</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch09_s07_s05_s02_p01">The huge wave of baby boomers began arriving in 1946, following World War II, and marketers have been catering to them ever since. What are they like? Sociologists have attributed to them such characteristics as “individuality, tolerance, and self-absorption.”<span class="footnote" id="fwk-collins-fn09_040">John Leo, “The Good-News Generation,” <em class="emphasis">U.S. News &amp; World Report</em>, November 3, 2003, <a class="link" href="http://www.keepmedia.com/pubs/USNewsWorldReport/2003/11/03/293076?extID=10026">http://www.keepmedia.com/pubs/USNewsWorldReport/2003/11/03/293076?extID=10026</a> (accessed May 21, 2006).</span> There are seventy million of them,<span class="footnote" id="fwk-collins-fn09_041">Ellen Neuborne and Kathleen Kerwin, “Generation Y,” <em class="emphasis">BusinessWeek Online</em>, February 15, 1999, <a class="link" href="http://www.businessweek.com/1999/99_07/b3616001.htm">http://www.businessweek.com/1999/99_07/b3616001.htm</a> (accessed May 21, 2006).</span> and as they marched through life over the course of five decades, marketers crowded the roadside to supply them with toys, clothes, cars, homes, and appliances—whatever they needed at the time. They’re still a major marketing force, but their needs have changed: they’re now the target market for Botox, pharmaceutical products, knee surgery, financial investments, cruises, vacation homes, and retirement communities.</p>

        <div class="section" id="collins-ch09_s07_s05_s03">
            <h2 class="title editable block">Generation X</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch09_s07_s05_s03_p01">Because birth rates had declined by the time the “Gen X” babies first arrived in 1965, this group had just one decade to grow its numbers.

Try to reach them through TV ads and they’ll channel-surf right past them or hit their TiVo remotes.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-collins-fn09_048">Anthony Bianco, “The Vanishing Mass Market,” <em class="emphasis">Business Week</em>, July 12, 2004, 61–68.</span> You can’t get to them over the Internet because they know all about pop-up blockers.

        <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch09_s07_s06_p01">Why did you buy an Apple computer when your friend bought a Dell PC? What information did you collect before making the decision? What factors did you consider when evaluating alternatives? How did you make your final choice? Were you happy with your decision? To design effective strategies, marketers need to find the answers that consumers give to questions such as these. In other words, they try to improve their understanding of <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">consumer behavior</a><span class="glossdef">Decision process that individuals go through when purchasing or using products.</span></span>—the decision process that individuals go through when purchasing or using products. In the next section, we’ll look at the process that buyers go through in choosing one product over another. Then, we’ll explore some factors that influence consumers’ behavior.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">The Buying Process</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch09_s07_s07_p01">Generally speaking, buyers run through a series of steps in deciding whether to purchase a particular product. Some purchases are made without much thought. You probably don’t think much, for example, about the brand of gasoline you put in your car; you just stop at the most convenient place. Other purchases, however, require considerable thought. For example, you probably spent a lot of time deciding which college to attend. Let’s revisit that decision as a means of examining the five steps that are involved in the consumer buying process and that are summarized in <a class="xref" href="#collins-ch09_s07_s07_f01">Figure 9.17 "The Buying Process"</a>: <em class="emphasis">need recognition, information search, evaluation, purchase</em>, and <em class="emphasis">postpurchase evaluation</em>.</p>

        <ol class="orderedlist editable block" id="collins-ch09_s07_s07_l01">
            <li>
<em class="emphasis">Need recognition</em>. The process began when you recognized a need to go to college. Perhaps you wanted to prepare for a particular career, to become better educated, or to postpone going to work full time. Maybe your parents insisted.</li>
            <li>
<em class="emphasis">Information search</em>. Once you recognized the need to go to college, you probably started gathering information about colleges. You may have gone online and studied the Web sites posted by a few schools. Perhaps you attended college fairs or spoke with your high school guidance counselor. You probably talked with friends about your options. Once you let colleges know that you were interested, admissions departments likely sent you tons of information.</li>
            <li>
<em class="emphasis">Evaluation</em>. At this point, you studied the information you’d gathered. First, you probably decided what you wanted from a college. Perhaps price was your number-one criterion, or maybe distance from home. Maybe size was important, or reputation or available majors. Maybe it was the quality of the football team or the male-to-female ratio.</li>
            <li>
<em class="emphasis">Purchase</em>. Ultimately you made a “purchase” decision. In so doing, you focused on what was most important to you. Naturally, you could choose only among schools that had accepted you.</li>
            <li>
<em class="emphasis">Postpurchase evaluation</em>. The buying process didn’t end when you selected a school. It continues today, while you’re using the “product” you purchased. How many times have you rethought your decision? Are you happy with it? Would you make the same choice again?</li>
        </ol>
        <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch09_s07_s07_p02">Understanding the buying process of potential students is crucial to college administrators in developing marketing strategies to attract qualified “buyers.” They’d certainly like to know what information you found useful, which factors most influenced your decision, and how you made your final choice. They’ll also want to know whether you’re happy with your choice. This is the kind of information that colleges are seeking when they solicit feedback, both from students who chose their schools and from those who didn’t.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Influences on Buying Behavior</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch09_s07_s08_p01">Did you ever buy something you knew you shouldn’t buy but just couldn’t help yourself—something you simply wanted? Maybe it was a spring-break trip to the Bahamas that you really couldn’t afford. Objectively, you may have made a bad decision, but not all decisions are made on a purely objective basis. <em class="emphasis">Psychological</em> and <em class="emphasis">social influences</em> come into play. Let’s take a closer look at each of these factors.</p>
        <div class="section" id="collins-ch09_s07_s08_s01">
            <h2 class="title editable block">Psychological Influences</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch09_s07_s08_s01_p01">Under this category, we can identify at least five variables:</p>
            <ol class="orderedlist editable block" id="collins-ch09_s07_s08_s01_l01">
                <li>

<em class="emphasis">Perception</em>. The way you select, organize, and interpret information.</li>
                <li>
<em class="emphasis">Learning</em>. Knowledge gained through experience and study.</li>

            <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch09_s07_s08_s02_p01">Here, we find four factors:</p>

                <li><em class="emphasis">Family</em></li>

<em class="emphasis">Reference groups</em>. Friends or other people with whom you identify.</li>
                <li><em class="emphasis">Economic or social status</em></li>
                <li>
<em class="emphasis">Culture</em>. Your set of accepted values.</li>
            </ol>
            <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch09_s07_s08_s02_p02">It shouldn’t be surprising that marketers are keenly interested in the effect of all these influences on your buying decisions. For instance, suppose the travel agency that sold you your spring-break getaway found that you bought the package because you viewed it as a reward for studying hard and doing well academically. In that case, it might promote student summer-travel programs as rewards for a hard year’s work at school.</p>

            <li>Describe opportunities in the field of marketing.</li>
        </ol>
    </div>
    <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch09_s08_p01">The field of marketing is extensive, and so are the opportunities for someone graduating with a marketing degree. While one person may seek out the excitement of an advertising agency that serves multiple clients, another might prefer to focus on brand management at a single organization. For someone else, working as a buyer for a retail chain is appealing. A few people might want to get into marketing research. Others might have an aptitude for supply chain management or <em class="emphasis">logistics management</em>, the aspect of supply chain management that focuses on the flow of products between suppliers and customers. Many people are attracted to sales positions because of the potential financial rewards. Let’s look more closely at a few of your options.</p>
    <div class="section" id="collins-ch09_s08_s01">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Advertising</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch09_s08_s01_p01">If you’re interested in advertising, you’ll probably start out at an <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">advertising agency</a><span class="glossdef">Marketing consulting firm that develops and executes promotional campaigns for clients.</span></span>—a marketing consulting firm that develops and executes promotional campaigns for clients. Professionals work on either the “creative” side (developing ads and other campaign materials) or the business side (acting as liaisons between the firm and its clients). If you’re new, you’ll probably begin as an assistant and work your way up. You might, for example, start as an assistant copywriter, helping to develop advertising messages. Or you could assist an account coordinator, helping in the management of accounts, including the planning and implementation of marketing campaigns.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section" id="collins-ch09_s08_s02">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Brand and Product Management</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch09_s08_s02_p01">Brand and product managers are responsible for all aspects of the development and marketing of assigned products. They oversee the marketing program, including marketing research, pricing, distribution, and promotion. They track and analyze sales, gather feedback from customers, and assess the competition. You’d probably join the company as a brand assistant assigned to a more senior-level manager. After a few years, you may be promoted to assistant brand manager and, eventually, to brand manager. At this point, you’d be given responsibility for your own brand or product.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section" id="collins-ch09_s08_s03">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Marketing Research</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch09_s08_s03_p01">Marketing researchers meet with company managers to determine their information needs. Then they gather and analyze relevant data, write reports, and present their findings and recommendations. If you want to get into this field, you’ll need to acquire some skills in disciplines outside marketing, including statistics, research methods, and psychology. You’ll start out as an assistant, but you may advance comparatively quickly.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section" id="collins-ch09_s08_s04">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Supply Chain and Logistics Management</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch09_s08_s04_p01">Effective supply chain management is vital to success in today’s business environment. Those who start their careers in supply chain management typically work in one of the following areas: purchasing and supply management, transportation and logistics, operations management, or inventory management and control. If this field appeals to you, you’ll need to take courses in several disciplines: management, marketing, operations management, and accounting. If you want to specialize in logistics management, you’ll be happy to know that many organizations—manufacturers, wholesalers, retailers, service providers, and transportation carriers—are looking for people interested in physical distribution. If you want to go into this field, you’ll need strong quantitative skills in addition to a background in business with a specialization in marketing.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section" id="collins-ch09_s08_s05">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Retailing</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch09_s08_s05_p01">Retailing offers all sorts of options, such as merchandise buying and store management. As a buyer, you’d select and buy merchandise for a department, a store, or maybe even an entire chain. Store managers display merchandise, supervise personnel, and handle day-to-day operations. Graduates looking for jobs in both areas generally start as trainees and work their way up.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section" id="collins-ch09_s08_s06">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Sales</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch09_s08_s06_p01">Many marketing graduates begin their careers in sales positions, often for service organizations, such as insurance, real estate, and financial-services companies. Others are employed in the wholesale and retail trades or enter the manufacturing sector, selling anything from industrial goods to pharmaceuticals. To succeed in sales, you need a thorough understanding of customers’ needs and an extensive knowledge of your product. You should also be able to communicate well, and you’ll need strong interpersonal skills. Bear in mind that experience in sales is excellent preparation for almost any position in business.</p>

Suddenly the page is plastered from top to bottom with <em class="emphasis">banner ads</em>. Some pop up, some float across the screen, and in some, animated figures dance and prance to inane music. As a user of the Internet, feel free to be annoyed. As a student of business, however, you should stop and ask yourself a few questions: Where do banner ads come from? Who stands to profit from them?</p>
        <p class="para" id="collins-ch09_s09_p02">To get a handle on these questions, go to the How Stuff Works Web site (<a class="link" href="http://computer.howstuffworks.com/web-advertising.htm">http://computer.howstuffworks.com/web-advertising.htm</a>) and read the article “How Web Advertising Works,” by Marshall Brain.

            <li>What are the advantages and disadvantages of banner ads? Why are they less popular with advertisers today than they were about ten years ago?</li>

            <li>Why are there so many ads on the Web? Is it easy to make money selling ads on the Web? Why, or why not?</li>
            <li>Assume that you’re in charge of Web advertising for a company that sells cell-phone ring tones. On which sites would you place your ads and what type of ads would you use? Why?</li>

        <p class="simpara"><strong class="emphasis bold">A “Late Fee” by Any Other Name</strong></p>
        <p class="para" id="collins-ch09_s09_p05">Why is there always time to get a DVD from Blockbuster and watch it, but never enough time to return it within the specified number of days? Are you fed up with late fees? Maybe you should get your movies through a mail-order service, such as Netflix, which lets you hold onto the DVDs for as long as you want in exchange for a monthly fee. But wait: Blockbuster has solved your dilemma by announcing “the end of late fees.” Maybe so and maybe not. The end of late fees isn’t <em class="emphasis">really</em> the end of late fees. As in so many deals that sound too good to be true, there’s some fine print. Here’s how it really works: The bad news is that eight days after the return date of your movie, your credit card is charged for the <em class="emphasis">selling price</em> of the DVD. The good news is that you can get the “sale” removed from your credit card if you return the DVD within thirty days. The bad news is that you’re charged a “restocking fee” to cover the cost to Blockbuster of processing the “temporary” sale. You <em class="emphasis">did</em> avoid a “late fee.” (By the way, not all Blockbuster outlets offer this value-added service; some still keep it simple by charging the time-honored late fee.)</p>
        <p class="para" id="collins-ch09_s09_p06">As a business student, you should be wondering whether Blockbuster’s end-of-late-fees campaign makes business sense. You should wonder whether it’s ethical. You may already know that the New Jersey Attorney General has charged Blockbuster with deceptive advertising and filed suit. But even if you know the opinion of one high-ranking legal official, you should (as always) be prepared to form your own. Answer the following questions (being sure to justify your answers):</p>
        <ol class="orderedlist" id="collins-ch09_s09_l03">
            <li>Did Blockbuster’s decision to establish a no-late-fee policy make good business sense?</li>
            <li>In informing consumers about this program, did Blockbuster engage in deceptive advertising?</li>
            <li>Were Blockbuster’s actions unethical?</li>

But that doesn’t mean that Apple’s lead in the market can’t be surmounted. Perhaps some enterprising college students will come up with an idea for a better iPod and put together a plan for bringing it to market.
