    <span class="blockquote block" id="collins-ch16_s04_bl01">
        <p class="para editable" id="collins-ch16_s04_p02">“Having escaped the house-painting business relatively unscathed, you head back home to rethink your options for gainful employment over your summer vacation. You’ve stored your only remaining capital assets—the two ladders and the platform that you’d used for scaffolding—in your father’s garage, where one afternoon, your uncle notices them. Examining one of the ladders, he asks you how much weight it’s designed to hold, and you tell him what the department manager at Ladders ’N’ Things told you—three hundred pounds per rung. He nods as if this is a good number, and, sensing that he might want to buy them, you hasten to add that though you got them at a cut-rate price because of a little rust, they’re virtually brand-new. As it turns out, he doesn’t want to buy them, but he does offer to pay you $35 an hour to take them to his house and help him put up new roofing. He’s easygoing, he’s family, and he probably won’t sue you for anything, so you jump at the opportunity.</p>
        <p class="para editable" id="collins-ch16_s04_p03">“Everything goes smoothly until day two, when you’re working on the scaffolding two stories off the ground. As you’re in the process of unwrapping a bundle of shingles, one of the ladders buckles, bringing down the platform and depositing you on your uncle’s stone patio with a cervical fracture.”</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch16_s04_s01_p01">It comes as no surprise when your lawyer advises an action for <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">product liability</a><span class="glossdef">Claim of injury suffered because of a defective product.</span></span>—a claim of injury suffered because of a defective product (in your case, of course, the ladder). The legal concept of product liability, he explains, developed out of the principles of tort law. He goes on to say that in cases of product liability, there are three grounds for pursuing a claim and seeking damages—what lawyers call three “theories of recovery”:</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch16_s04_s01_s01_p01">In selecting defendants in your case, you’ll start with the manufacturer of the ladder. Manufacturer’s negligence—carelessness—can take three different forms:<span class="footnote" id="fwk-collins-fn16_021">This section is based on Nancy A. Kubasek, Bartley A. Brennan, and M. Neil Browne, <em class="emphasis">The Legal Environment of Business: A Critical Thinking Approach</em>, 5th ed. (Upper Saddle River, NJ: Pearson Education, 2009), 377–81.</span></p>

                <li>
<em class="emphasis">Negligent failure to warn</em>. The manufacturer may be liable if the company knew (or should have known) that, without a warning, the ladder would be dangerous in ordinary use or in any reasonably foreseeable use. It’s possible, for example, that you made the ladder’s collapse more likely by placing it at a less than optimal angle from the wall of the house. That mistake, however, is a reasonably foreseeable use of the product, and if the manufacturer failed to warn you of this possibility, the company is liable for failure to warn.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-collins-fn16_022">This example is borrowed from Scott Baldwin, Francis Hare, and Francis E. McGovern, <em class="emphasis">The Preparation of a Product Liability Case</em> (New York: Aspen Publishers Online, 1998), 2–38, <a class="link" href="http://books.google.com/books?id=KOvn3Dz5-HAC&amp;pg=PA76&amp;lpg=PA76&amp;dq=ladder%2Bdefective+design&amp;source=web&amp;ots=5fE8wEN7Yp&amp;sig=RfevWGFp_s9jsZbfq9t7P_wnOHQ&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=7&amp;ct=result">http://books.google.com/books?id=KOvn3Dz5-HAC&amp;pg=PA76&amp;lpg=PA76&amp;dq=ladder%2Bdefective+design&amp;source=web&amp;ots=5fE8wEN7Yp&amp;sig=RfevWGFp_s9jsZbfq9t7P_wnOHQ&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=7&amp;ct=result</a> (accessed November 5, 2008).</span>
</li>
                <li>
<em class="emphasis">Negligent design</em>. As the term suggests, this principle applies to defectively designed products. In law, a product is defective if, despite any warnings, the risk of harm outweighs its usefulness in doing what it’s designed to do. If, for example, your ladder left the manufacturer’s facility with rivets that were likely to break when weight was placed on it, the ladder may be judged defective in its design.</li>
            </ul>

            <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="collins-ch16_s04_s01_s01_l02">
                <li>
<em class="emphasis">Negligence per se</em>. The manufacturer may be liable if the ladder fails to meet legal standards. According to standards set by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), for example, the rungs on your ladder should be corrugated or covered with skid-resistant material to minimize slipping. If you’re injured because they’re not, the manufacturer may be liable on grounds of negligence per se.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-collins-fn16_023">Occupational Safety and Health Administration, <em class="emphasis">Stairways and Ladders: A Guide to OSHA Rules</em> (Washington, DC: U.S. Dept. of Labor, 2003), 7, <a class="link" href="http://www.osha.gov/Publications/osha3124.pdf">http://www.osha.gov/Publications/osha3124.pdf</a> (accessed November 5, 2008).</span>

            <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch16_s04_s01_s01_p02">If you decide to apply the concept of negligence in suing the manufacturer of the ladder, you must prove the four elements of a negligence case that we detailed above—namely, the following:</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch16_s04_s01_s02_p01">For the sake of argument, let’s say that your lawyer isn’t very confident about pursuing a claim of negligence against the manufacturer of your ladder. The company doesn’t appear to have been careless in any of the three forms prescribed by law, and it will in any case be difficult to demonstrate all four elements required in negligence cases. He suggests instead that you proceed on grounds of strict liability, pointing out that the principle of strict liability often makes the plaintiff’s legal task less exacting. But (you ask) if the company wasn’t <em class="emphasis">negligent</em>, how can it be <em class="emphasis">liable</em>, either “strictly” or in any other sense? Under the <em class="emphasis">doctrine of strict liability in tort</em>, he replies, you don’t have to prove negligence on the manufacturer’s part. He goes on to explain that under this doctrine, your right to compensation for injury is based on two legal suppositions:</p>
            <ol class="orderedlist editable block" id="collins-ch16_s04_s01_s02_l01">
                <li>Certain products put people at risk of injury no matter how much care is taken to prevent injury.</li>
                <li>Consumers should have some means of seeking compensation if they’re injured while using these products.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-collins-fn16_024">See Henry R. Cheesman, <em class="emphasis">Contemporary Business and Online Commerce Law: Legal, Internet, Ethical, and Global Environments</em>, 5th ed. (Upper Saddle River, NJ: Pearson Education, 2006), 93.</span>
</li>
            </ol>
            <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch16_s04_s01_s02_p02">Day in and day out, of course, people use ladders quite successfully. According to the Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC), however, every year accidents involving ladders cause three hundred deaths and one hundred thirty thousand injuries requiring emergency medical treatment.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-collins-fn16_025">American Ladder Institute, “Ladder Safety and Education” (2002), at <a class="link" href="http://www.americanladderinstitute.org/ali/about_ali.asp">http://www.americanladderinstitute.org/ali/about_ali.asp</a> (accessed November 3, 2008); see also “Ladder Injuries Climbing, Study Finds,” <em class="emphasis">ConsumerAffairs.com</em>, May 1, 2007, <a class="link" href="http://www.consumeraffairs.com/news04/2007/05/ladder_safety.html">http://www.consumeraffairs.com/news04/2007/05/ladder_safety.html</a> (accessed November 8, 2008).</span> In a certain number of these instances, the ladder is defective, and in cases of strict liability, it doesn’t matter how much care was taken by the manufacturer to prevent defects. This seems a little harsh to you, but your lawyer explains that, in establishing the doctrine of strict liability in tort, the court cited two reasons for making the grounds of liability so strict:<span class="footnote" id="fwk-collins-fn16_026">See <em class="emphasis">Greenman v. Yuba Power Products</em> (1963), <a class="link" href="http://online.ceb.com/CalCases/C2/59C2d57.htm">http://online.ceb.com/CalCases/C2/59C2d57.htm</a> (accessed November 3, 2008).</span></p>
            <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="collins-ch16_s04_s01_s02_l02">
                <li>The manufacturer can protect itself by taking steps to anticipate and prevent hazardous product features, but the public can’t.</li>
                <li>The manufacturer can protect itself by purchasing insurance and passing the cost on to the public in the form of higher product prices. Again, the public enjoys no such protection.</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch16_s04_s01_s02_p03">Under these conditions, the manufacturer is willing to take a risk—namely, the risk of making available a product that’s potentially dangerous, especially if defective. The manufacturer thus takes the first step in a process whereby this product reaches a consumer who may suffer “overwhelming misfortune” by using it, especially if it has become defective <em class="emphasis">during the process that takes it from the manufacturer to the user</em>. “Even if he is not negligent in the manufacture of the product,” declared the court, the manufacturer “is <em class="emphasis">responsible for its reaching the market</em>” (italics added). There’s no way of telling when or how a product will become defective or of predicting how or how many people will be injured by it. Defects and injuries, however, are “constant” dangers when people use such products, and users must therefore have some form of “constant protection” under law. That protection is established by the doctrine of strict liability in tort. Why should the manufacturer be held responsible for such defects and injuries? Because, reasoned the court, “the manufacturer is best situated to afford…protection.”</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch16_s04_s01_s02_p04">And this, explains your lawyer, is why you’re going to sue the manufacturer of your ladder on grounds of strict liability.</p>
            <div class="section" id="collins-ch16_s04_s01_s02_s01">
                <h2 class="title editable block">Strict Liability in the Distribution Chain</h2>
                <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch16_s04_s01_s02_s01_p01">You’re excited about the prospect of recovering monetary damages from the manufacturer of your ladder, but you continue to wonder (on completely hypothetical grounds, of course) whether the doctrine of strict liability is as fair as it should be. What about all the other businesses involved in the process of getting the product from the manufacturer to the user—especially the one that did in fact introduce the defect that caused all the trouble? Does the doctrine of strict liability relieve them of all liability in the case? Indeed not, your lawyer assures you. The concept of strict liability not only provides more practical grounds for suing the manufacturer, but also supports your right to pursue claims against members of the manufacturer’s distribution chain (see <a class="xref" href="collins-ch09#collins-ch09">Chapter 9 "Marketing: Providing Value to Customers"</a>).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-collins-fn16_027">See Henry R. Cheesman, <em class="emphasis">Contemporary Business and Online Commerce Law: Legal, Internet, Ethical, and Global Environments</em>, 5th ed. (Upper Saddle River, NJ: Pearson Education, 2006), 370.</span> That’s one reason, he points out, why product-liability lawsuits against businesses that sell such “unreasonably dangerous” products as ladders (or even deliver them to worksites) went up a hundredfold between 1950 and 2001, to a total of $205 billion.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-collins-fn16_028">Conrad Shawn, “Tackling Product Liability: NLBMDA to Introduce Product Liability Legislation,” <em class="emphasis">AllBusiness</em>, January 1, 2006, <a class="link" href="http://www.allbusiness.com/wholesale-trade/merchant-wholesalers-durable-goods-lumber/855278-1.html">http://www.allbusiness.com/wholesale-trade/merchant-wholesalers-durable-goods-lumber/855278-1.html</a> (accessed November 2, 2008).</span></p>
                <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch16_s04_s01_s02_s01_p02">Now, let’s say that your lawyer has given your defective ladder to a forensic laboratory in order to find out exactly what caused it to buckle and you to fall. As it turns out, the clue to the problem is the small patch of rust that brought down the price you paid for the ladder when you bought it. The ladder, concludes the lab, had for some time been in close proximity to liquid nitrogen, which can corrode various metals, including aluminum.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-collins-fn16_029">See David E. Baker and Rusty Lee, “Portable Ladder Safety,” <em class="emphasis">National Ag Safety Database</em>, October 1993, <a class="link" href="http://nasdonline.org/document/1091/d000877/portable-ladder-safety.html">http://nasdonline.org/document/1091/d000877/portable-ladder-safety.html</a> (accessed November 2, 2008).</span> Sure enough, further investigation reveals that the entire shipment of ladders had been stored for nearly two years in a Ladders ’N’ Things warehouse next to an inventory of liquid-nitrogen–based fertilizer. Your lawyer advises you that, in addition to your strict-liability case against the manufacturer of the ladder, you have a strong negligence case against the retailer from which you purchased it.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch16_s04_s01_s03_p01">Moreover, adds your lawyer, there’s one more matter to be considered in determining liability for your injury. Had not the department manager at Ladders ’N’ Things assured you that the ladder would support a weight of three hundred pounds per rung? Your uncle had asked you about the weight capacity of the ladder because he knew that the roofing job meant putting heavy bundles of shingles on the scaffold. A ladder that holds three hundred pounds per rung is a Type IA extra-heavy–duty ladder suitable for such jobs as roofing and construction. According to the lab, however, the construction of your ladder is that of a Type II medium-duty–commercial ladder made for lighter-weight tasks.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-collins-fn16_030">“Ladders: A Ladder for Every Task: Ladder Types and Industry Ratings,” <em class="emphasis">Guide4Home</em> (2008), <a class="link" href="http://www.guide4home.com/rem-lad">http://www.guide4home.com/rem-lad</a> (accessed November 6, 2008).</span> The manager at Ladders ’N’ Things, explains your lawyer, may have been guilty of <em class="emphasis">breach of warranty</em>—yet further grounds for holding the retailer liable in your product-liability case.</p>

                <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch16_s04_s01_s03_s03_p03">What kinds of warranties did you receive when you bought your ladder? Naturally, you received implied warranties of merchantability, which arose out of your transaction with Ladders ’N’ Things. You also received an implied warranty of fitness for a particular purpose (that the ladder would hold a scaffolding platform) and an express warranty (that it would a bear a weight of three hundred pounds per rung).</p>
                <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch16_s04_s01_s03_s03_p04">Do you have a case for product liability on grounds of breach of warranty? Arguably, says your lawyer, Ladders ’N’ Things breached an implied warranty of merchantability because it sold you a ladder with a defect (corrosion damage) that made it unfit for ordinary use. It’s also possible that the retailer breached an express warranty—the manager’s assurance that the ladder would bear a weight of three hundred pounds per rung. First, the court will want to know whether that express warranty was a contributing factor—not necessarily the sole factor—in your decision to buy the ladder. If not, you probably can’t recover for breach of the express warranty.</p>
                <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch16_s04_s01_s03_s03_p05">Second, there’s the complex issue of whether that express warranty was tantamount to an assurance that the ladder could be used for such a job as roofing. Apparently your uncle thought it was, but that will be a matter for your lawyer to argue and the court to decide. It will all depend, in other words, on the flexibility and fairness of the legal system.</p>

Your lawyer replies that it’s a matter of <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">agency</a><span class="glossdef">Legal relationship in which one party acts on behalf of, and under the control of, another.</span></span>, which he defines for you as a legal relationship between two parties in which one party acts on behalf of, and under the control of, another.

                <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch16_s04_s01_s03_s04_p02">A lawyer acting on behalf of a client is an agent, as is a real estate broker acting on behalf of a homeowner or a partner acting on behalf of a partnership. Perhaps the most common type of agency relationship is the one that applies to your case—the salesperson who’s acting on behalf of a retailer. If this sort of legal arrangement sounds familiar, that’s probably because employer-employee relationships are also agency relationships.</p>

As we’ve also seen, an agent (such as the department manager at your local Ladders ’N’ Things outlet) can make the principal for whom he or she is acting liable for such torts as breach of warranty. The same thing is true of the warehouse manager who stored your ladder next to a shipment of liquid-nitrogen–based fertilizer; acting on behalf of Ladders ’N’ Things, he or she exposed the company to liability for negligence.</p>

Some measures of compensatory damages are easier to establish than others—say, such expenses as medical costs. Likewise, if your injury keeps you from working at your job or profession, the court can calculate the amount that you would have earned while you were incapacitated. Things get more complicated when plaintiffs make claims involving pain and suffering or emotional distress (which may include both present and future physical and mental impairment). In deciding whether or not to award compensatory damages for such claims, it’s the job of judges and juries to use common sense, good judgment, and general experience.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-collins-fn16_034">See “Compensatory Damages,” <em class="emphasis">Law Library: American Law and Legal Information</em> (2008), <a class="link" href="http://law.jrank.org/pages/5947/Damages-Compensatory-Damages.html">http://law.jrank.org/pages/5947/Damages-Compensatory-Damages.html</a> (accessed November 8, 2008).</span></p>

Some experts regard punitive damages as particularly useful in discouraging manufacturers from making unsafe products: if there were no risk of punitive damages, they argue, a manufacturer might find it cheaper to market an unsafe product and compensate injured consumers than to develop a safer product. To determine whether punitive damages are called for, a court usually considers “the degree of reprehensibility of the defendant’s conduct”—that is, the extent to which the defendant’s action was flagrant or unconscionable.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-collins-fn16_035"><em class="emphasis">BMW of North America v.

<strong class="emphasis bold">Product liability</strong> is a claim of injury suffered because of a defective product. In such cases, there are three grounds for pursuing a claim and seeking damages (that is, three “theories of recovery”): negligence, strict liability, and breach of warranty. Most plaintiffs use as many of these three grounds as possible.</li>
                    <li>
                        <p class="para">In a product-liability case, a manufacturer’s negligence can take three different forms:</p>
                        <ol class="orderedlist" id="collins-ch16_s04_s02_s02_l02">
                            <li>
<em class="emphasis">Negligent failure to warn</em>. The manufacturer may be liable if the company knew (or should have known) that, without a warning, the ladder would be dangerous in ordinary use or in any reasonably foreseeable use.</li>
                            <li>
<em class="emphasis">Negligent design</em>. A product is defective if, despite any warnings, the risk of harm outweighs its usefulness in doing what it’s designed to do.</li>
                            <li>
<em class="emphasis">Negligence per se</em>. The manufacturer may be liable if the ladder fails to meet legal standards.</li>
                        </ol>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p class="para"><strong class="emphasis bold">Strict liability torts</strong> involve actions that are inherently dangerous and for which a party may be liable no matter how carefully he or she performs them. Under the <em class="emphasis">doctrine of strict liability in tort</em>, the plaintiff doesn’t have to prove negligence on the manufacturer’s part, nor does it matter how much care was taken by the manufacturer to prevent defects. The doctrine of strict liability rests on two legal conclusions:</p>
                        <ol class="orderedlist" id="collins-ch16_s04_s02_s02_l03">
                            <li>The manufacturer can protect itself by taking steps to anticipate and prevent hazardous product features, but the public can’t.</li>
                            <li>The manufacturer can protect itself by purchasing insurance and passing the cost on to the public in the form of higher product prices; the consumer has no such protection. The manufacturer is liable under the doctrine of strict liability for any harm that comes to a person from using the product, especially if it has become defective during the process of getting the product from the manufacturer to the user. The concept of strict liability also supports the plaintiff’s right to pursue claims against members of the manufacturer’s distribution chain.</li>
                            <li>Breaching a <strong class="emphasis bold">warranty</strong>—a guarantee that a product meets certain standards of performance—is grounds for recovering in a product-liability case. An <strong class="emphasis bold">express warranty</strong> is created when a seller affirms that a product meets certain standards of quality, description, performance, or condition. An <strong class="emphasis bold">implied warranty</strong> arises automatically out of a transaction and takes one of two forms: (1) an <em class="emphasis">implied warranty of merchantability</em> (which states that the product is reasonably fit for ordinary use) and (2) an <em class="emphasis">implied warranty of fitness for a particular purpose</em> (which states that the product is fit for some specific use).</li>
                            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Agency</strong> is a legal relationship between two parties in which one party acts on behalf of, and under the control of, another. In a <em class="emphasis">principal–agent relationship</em>, the <em class="emphasis">agent</em> is acting on behalf of the <em class="emphasis">principal</em>. Employer-employee relationships are also agency relationships.</li>
                            <li>The primary goal of tort law is restoring the victim to the condition that he or she would have been in had no injury ever taken place. Likewise, the primary goal of contract law is restoring the nonbreaching party to the condition that he or she would have been in had the contract not been breached. To achieve these goals, the legal system provides for monetary awards in the form of <strong class="emphasis bold">compensatory damages</strong>. Another form of monetary award, <strong class="emphasis bold">punitive damages</strong>, is intended to punish, to deter similar injurious conduct in the future, or to set an example.</li>
