        <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch15_s05_s01_p01">Though we often use the terms <em class="emphasis">Internet</em> and <em class="emphasis">World Wide Web</em> interchangeably, they’re not the same thing.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-collins-fn15_016">See “The Difference Between the Internet and the World Wide Web,” <em class="emphasis">Webopedia</em>, <a class="link" href="http://www.webopedia.com/DidYouKnow/Internet/2002/Web_vs_Internet.asp">http://www.webopedia.com/DidYouKnow/Internet/2002/Web_vs_Internet.asp</a> (accessed June 2, 2006).</span> The <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Internet</a><span class="glossdef">Global network comprising smaller interconnected networks linking millions of computers around the world.</span></span> is an immense global network comprising smaller interconnected networks linking millions of computers around the world. Originally developed for the U.S. military and later adapted for use in academic and government research, the Internet experienced rapid growth in the 1990s, when companies called <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Internet service providers (ISPs)</a><span class="glossdef">Company, such as America Online, that links into the Internet infrastructure to connect paying subscribers.</span></span> were allowed to link into the Internet infrastructure in order to connect paying subscribers. Today, ISPs, such as CompuServe, America Online, and MSN, enable us to use the Internet for e-mail, online conferencing, instant messaging, and real-time communication (chatting). These services also connect us with third-party providers of information, including news stories, stock quotes, and magazine articles.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch15_s05_s01_p02">The <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">World Wide Web</a><span class="glossdef">Subsystem of computers on the Internet that communicate with each other using a special language called HTTP.</span></span> (or simply “the Web”) is just a portion of the Internet—albeit a large portion. The Web is a subsystem of computers that can be accessed on the Internet using a special protocol, or language, known as <em class="emphasis">hypertext transfer protocol</em> (HTTP). What’s the difference between the Internet and the Web? According to Tim Berners-Lee (one of the small team of scientists who developed the concept for the Web in 1989), the Internet is a network of networks composed of cables and computers. You can use it to send “packets” of information from one computer to another, much like sending a postcard. If the address on the packet is accurate, it will arrive at the correct destination in much less than a second. Thus, the Internet is a packet-delivery <em class="emphasis">service</em> that delivers such items as e-mail messages all over the globe. The Web, by contrast, is composed of <em class="emphasis">information</em>—documents, pictures, sounds, streaming videos, and so on. It’s connected not through cables, but rather through <em class="emphasis">hypertext links</em> that allow users to navigate between resources on the Internet.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-collins-fn15_017">Richard T. Griffiths, “Chapter Two: The World Wide Web (WWW),” <em class="emphasis">The History of the Internet</em>, <a class="link" href="http://www.let.leidenuniv.nl/history/ivh/chap2.htm">http://www.let.leidenuniv.nl/history/ivh/chap2.htm</a> (accessed June 2, 2006).</span></p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch15_s05_s01_p03">Because it’s driven by programs that communicate between computers connected to the Internet, the Web couldn’t exist without the Internet. The Internet, on the other hand, could exist without the Web, but it wouldn’t be nearly as useful. The Internet itself is enormous, but it’s difficult to navigate, and it has no pictures, sounds, or streamed videos. They exist on computers connected to the Web, which also makes it much easier to retrieve information. The creation of Web <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">browsers</a><span class="glossdef">Software (such as Internet Explorer) that locates and displays Web pages.</span></span>—software, such as Microsoft’s Internet Explorer and Netscape Navigator, that locates and displays Web pages—opened up the Internet to a vast range of users. More than 60 percent of individuals in the United States age eighteen and older use the Internet regularly.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-collins-fn15_018">Rob McGann, “People Aged 55 and Up Drive U.S. Web Growth,” <em class="emphasis">ClickZ Network</em>, <a class="link" href="http://www.clickz.com/stats/sectors/traffic_patterns/article.php/3446641">http://www.clickz.com/stats/sectors/traffic_patterns/article.php/3446641</a> (accessed June 2, 2006).</span> So, who’s in charge of the Web? No one owns it, but an organization called the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) oversees the development and maintenance of standards governing the way information is stored, displayed, and retrieved on it.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-collins-fn15_019">“World Wide Web,” <em class="emphasis">Wikipedia</em>, <a class="link" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Wide_Web">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Wide_Web</a> (accessed June 2, 2006).</span></p>

Documents on the Web are called <em class="emphasis">Web pages</em>, and they’re stored on <em class="emphasis">Web sites</em>. Each site is maintained by a <em class="emphasis">Webmaster</em> and opens with a <em class="emphasis">home page</em>. Each Web page is accessed through a unique address called a <em class="emphasis">uniform resource locator (URL)</em>. For example, if you want to find statistics on basketball star Shaquille O’Neal, you could type in the URL address <a class="link" href="http://www.nba.com/playerfile/shaquille_oneal">http://www.nba.com/playerfile/shaquille_oneal</a>. The prefix <em class="emphasis">http://</em> is the protocol name, <em class="emphasis">http://www.nba.com</em> the domain name, <em class="emphasis">playerfile</em> the subdirectory name, and <em class="emphasis">shaquille_oneal</em> the document name (or Web page). A computer that retrieves Web pages is called a <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Web server</a><span class="glossdef">Computer that retrieves Web pages.</span></span>. A <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">search engine</a><span class="glossdef">Software program that scans Web pages for specified kewords and provides a list of documents containing them.</span></span> is a software program that scans Web pages containing specified keywords and provides a list of documents containing them.

        <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch15_s05_s02_p01">What’s the difference among the Internet, an intranet, and an extranet? It depends on who can and can’t access the information on the network. The Internet is a public network that anyone can use. A company’s <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">intranet</a><span class="glossdef">Private network using Internet technologies that are available only to employees.</span></span>, on the other hand, is a private network using Internet technologies that’s available only to employees; access is controlled by a software program called a <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">firewall</a><span class="glossdef">Software program that controls access to a company’s intranet.</span></span>. The information available on an intranet varies by company but may include internal job postings, written company policies, and proprietary information, such as price lists meant for internal use only.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch15_s05_s02_p02">An <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">extranet</a><span class="glossdef">Intranet that’s partially available to certain parties outside the organization.</span></span> is an intranet that’s partially available to certain parties outside the organization. Say, for example, you’ve posted the following information on your intranet: company policies, payroll and benefit information, training programs, parts specifications and inventories, and production schedules. To allow suppliers to bid on contracts, you might give them access to sections of the site disclosing parts specifications, inventories, and production schedules. All other sections would be off-limits. You’d control access to employee-only and supplier-accessible sections by means of usernames and passwords. As you can see from <a class="xref" href="#collins-ch15_s05_s02_f01">Figure 15.10 "How an Extranet Works"</a>, which illustrates some of the connections made possible by an extranet, access can be made available to customers and business partners, as well.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch15_s05_s03_s02_p01">Imagine a company that retails products for schoolteachers over the Internet—for example, books, software, and teaching supplies purchased from various manufacturers and distributors. It would need facilities to store inventories and personnel to handle inventories and fill customer orders. But what if this company decided to get out of the traditional retail business? What if it decided instead to team up with three trading partners—a book publisher, a software developer, and a manufacturer of office supplies? Our original company could re-create itself as a Web site for marketing the books, software, and supplies provided by its partners, without taking physical possession of them. It would become a <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">virtual company</a><span class="glossdef">Company without a significant physical presence that relies on third parties to produce, warehouse, price, and deliver the products it sells over the Internet.</span></span>. Its partners would warehouse their own products and furnish product descriptions, prices, and delivery times. Meanwhile, the virtual company, besides promoting all three lines of products, would verify customer orders and forward them to its partners, who would ship their own products directly to customers. All four partners would be better off, because they’d be competing in a business in which none of them could compete by itself. This business approach has allowed Spun.com, a CD Internet retailer, to avoid carrying the $8 million inventory that it would have needed to support its sales. Rather than hold its own inventory, Spun.com merely passes the orders on to Alliance Entertainment (a home entertainment products wholesale distributor), which ships them directly to customers.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-collins-fn15_022">“Can E-Tailers Find Fulfillment with Drop Shipping?” <em class="emphasis">Research at Penn</em>, <a class="link" href="http://www.upenn.edu/researchatpenn/article.php?21&amp;bus">http://www.upenn.edu/researchatpenn/article.php?21&amp;bus</a> (accessed June 2, 2006).</span></p>
