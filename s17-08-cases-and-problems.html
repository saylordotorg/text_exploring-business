        <p class="para" id="collins-ch13_s08_p01"><strong class="emphasis bold">How Much Should You Reveal in <em class="emphasis">Playboy</em>?</strong></p>
        <p class="para" id="collins-ch13_s08_p02">What can you do if you’re sitting around your dorm room with nothing else to do (or at least nothing else you want to do)? How about starting a business? It worked for Michael Dell, who found assembling and selling computers more rewarding than attending classes at the University of Texas. It also worked for two Stanford graduate students, Sergey Brin and Larry Page. They came up with a novel (though fairly simple) idea for a search engine that ranked Web sites according to number of hits and online linkages. Because their goal was to organize massive amounts of electronic data, they wanted a name that connoted seemingly infinite volumes of information. They liked the word “googol” (a child’s coinage for a very big number—1 followed by a hundred zeros), but, unfortunately, someone already owned the domain name “Googol.” So Brin and Page did a little letter juggling and settled (as we all know by now) for “Google.”</p>
        <p class="para" id="collins-ch13_s08_p03">By 2004, the company that they’d started in 1998 was the number-one search engine in the world. Their next step, like that of so many successful entrepreneurs before them, was to go public, and that’s where our exercise starts. To learn more about this episode in the epic story of Google—and to find out what role <em class="emphasis">Playboy</em> magazine plays in it—read the article, “Google Sets $2.7 Billion IPO” (<a class="link" href="http://money.cnn.com/2004/04/29/technology/google">http://money.cnn.com/2004/04/29/technology/google</a>), read Google’s <em class="emphasis">Playboy</em> interview (<a class="link" href="http://www.google-watch.org/playboy.html">http://www.google-watch.org/playboy.html</a>), and read the BusinessWeek article, “Google Dodges a Bullet” (<a class="link" href="http://www.businessweek.com/technology/content/jan2005/tc20050114_0781_tc119.htm">http://www.businessweek.com/technology/content/jan2005/tc20050114_0781_tc119.htm</a>).</p>
        <p class="para" id="collins-ch13_s08_p04">When you’ve finished reading the articles, answer the following questions:</p>
        <ol class="orderedlist" id="collins-ch13_s08_l01">
            <li>What’s an IPO? Why did Brin and Page take their company public? What disadvantages did they incur by going public? Are they likely to lose control of their company?</li>
            <li>How does a <em class="emphasis">Playboy</em> interview enter into the Google story? What did Brin and Page do wrong? (By the way, the interview appeared in the August 2004 issue of <em class="emphasis">Playboy</em>; because Google incorporated the text into its revised IPO filing, it’s now in the public domain and available online.)</li>
            <li>
                <p class="para">Did the Google founders get off the hook? Was the punishment (or lack of it) appropriate? Quitting school to run Google paid off big for Brin and Page. Their combined net worth as a result of the IPO suddenly skyrocketed to $8 billion. But how about you? Could you have gotten rich if you’d jumped on the Google bandwagon just as it started to roll? Could you at least have earned enough to pay another year’s tuition? To respond to these questions, you need to know two things: (1) the IPO price of Google stock—$85—and (2) Google’s current stock price. To find the current price, go to <a class="link" href="http://finance.yahoo.com">http://finance.yahoo.com</a> to link to the finance section of the Yahoo.com Web site. Enter Google’s stock symbol—GOOG—and click “Go.” When you find the current stock price, answer the following questions:</p>
                <ol class="orderedlist" id="collins-ch13_s08_l02" numeration="loweralpha">
                    <li>If you’d bought Google stock on the IPO date and sold it today, how many shares of Google would you have had to buy in order to make enough to cover this year’s tuition?</li>
                    <li>If you owned Google stock today, would you sell it or hold it? Explain your answer.</li>

        <p class="para" id="collins-ch13_s08_p05"><strong class="emphasis bold">Financial Futures</strong></p>
        <p class="para" id="collins-ch13_s08_p06">One advantage of a finance major is that it prepares you for a wide range of careers. Some graduates head for Wall Street to make big bucks in investment banking. Others prefer the security of working in the corporate finance department of a large firm, while still others combine finance and selling in fields such as insurance or real estate. If you like working with other people’s finances, you might end up in commercial banking or financial planning. To better acquaint yourself with the range of available finance careers, go to <a class="link" href="http://www.careers-in-finance.com/">http://www.careers-in-finance.com/</a> to link to the Careers in Finance Web site. After reviewing the descriptions of each career option, select two areas that you find particularly interesting and two that you find unattractive. For each of your four selections, answer the following questions:</p>
        <ol class="orderedlist" id="collins-ch13_s08_l03">
            <li>Why do you find a given area interesting (or unattractive)?</li>
            <li>What experience and expertise are entailed by a career in a given area?</li>

        <h3 class="title">Ethics Angle (AACSB)</h3>
        <p class="para" id="collins-ch13_s08_p07"><strong class="emphasis bold">The Inside Story</strong></p>
        <p class="para" id="collins-ch13_s08_p08">You’re the founder and CEO of a publicly traded biotech firm that recently came up with a promising cancer drug. Right now, life on Wall Street is good: investors are high on your company, and your stock price is rising. On top of everything else, your personal wealth is burgeoning because you own a lot of stock in the company. You’re simply waiting to hear from the FDA, which is expected to approve the product. But when the call comes, the news is bad: the FDA has decided to delay approval because of insufficient data on the drug’s effectiveness. You know that when investors hear the news, the company’s stock price will plummet. The family and friends that you encouraged to buy into your company will lose money, and you’ll take a major hit.</p>
        <p class="para" id="collins-ch13_s08_p09">Quickly, you place an order to sell about $5 million worth of your own stock. Then you start making phone calls. You tell your daughter to dump her stock, and you advise your friends to do the same thing. When you tell your stockbroker the news, he gets on the phone and gives a heads-up to his other clients. Unfortunately, he can’t reach one client (who happens to be a good friend of yours), so he instructs his assistant to contact her and tell her what’s happened. As a result, the client places an order to sell four thousand shares of stock at a market value of $225,000.</p>
        <p class="para" id="collins-ch13_s08_p10">Let’s pause at this point to answer a few questions:</p>
        <ol class="orderedlist" id="collins-ch13_s08_l04">
            <li>Are you being a nice guy or doing something illegal?</li>
            <li>Is your stockbroker doing something illegal?</li>
            <li>Is the assistant doing something illegal or merely following orders?</li>
            <li>Is the stockbroker’s client acting illegally?</li>
        </ol>
        <p class="para" id="collins-ch13_s08_p11">Fast-forward a few months. Federal investigators are interested in the sale of your stock and the sale of your daughter’s stock. Because all signs point to the truth as being an invitation to trouble, you lie. When they talked with your friend about her sale, say investigators, she explained a standing agreement that instructed her broker to sell the stock when the market price went below a specified level. It sounds like a good explanation, so you go along with it.</p>
        <p class="para" id="collins-ch13_s08_p12">Now, answer this question.</p>
        <ol class="orderedlist" id="collins-ch13_s08_l05" start="5">
            <li>What have you done wrong? What has your client friend done wrong?</li>
        </ol>
        <p class="para" id="collins-ch13_s08_p13"><strong class="emphasis bold">The Reality Version of the Story</strong></p>
        <p class="para" id="collins-ch13_s08_p14">At this point, let’s stop protecting the not-so-innocent and name some names. The biotech company is ImClone, and its founder and CEO is Dr. Samuel Waksal. The Merrill Lynch broker is named Peter Bacanovic and his assistant Douglas Faneuil. The client friend who dumped her stock is Martha Stewart.</p>
        <p class="para" id="collins-ch13_s08_p15">Let’s focus on Stewart, who is the founder of Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia, a prosperous lifestyle empire. Her actions and their consequences are detailed in an article entitled “Martha’s Fall,” which you can access by going to <a class="link" href="http://www.newsweek.com/id/53363">http://www.newsweek.com/id/53363</a> and linking to the MSNBC Web site. Read the article and then answer the following questions:</p>
        <ol class="orderedlist" id="collins-ch13_s08_l06" start="6">
            <li>Do you believe Stewart’s story that she sold the stock because of a preexisting sell order and not because she learned that the cancer drug wouldn’t be approved? What did she do that was illegal? What was she actually <em class="emphasis">convicted</em> of doing?</li>
            <li>Waksal got seven years in prison for insider trading (and a few other illegal schemes). Bacanovic (Stewart’s broker) got five months in jail and five months of home confinement for lying and obstructing the investigation into the sale of ImClone stock. In return for helping the prosecutors convict Stewart, Faneuil (the broker’s assistant) got a federal “get-out-of-jail” card but was fined $2,000 for accepting a payoff (namely, an extra week of vacation and a bump in his commission) to stonewall investigators. Stewart went to prison for five months and spent another five under house arrest. Was her punishment too lenient? Too harsh? If you’d been the judge, what sentence would you have given her?</li>
            <li>How could Stewart have avoided prison? Did her celebrity status or reputation help or hurt her? Did she, as some people claim, become a poster CEO for corporate wrongdoing?</li>
            <li>Why are government agencies, such as the SEC, concerned about insider trading? Who’s hurt by it? Who’s helped by government enforcement of insider-trading laws?</li>

        <p class="para" id="collins-ch13_s08_p17">Congratulations! Your team has just been awarded $100,000 in hypothetical capital. There is, however, a catch: you have to spend the money on airline stocks. Rather than fly by the seat of your pants, you’ll want to research a number of stocks. To get started, go to <a class="link" href="http://biz.yahoo.com/ic/770.html">http://biz.yahoo.com/ic/770.html</a> to link to the airline-industry section of the Yahoo.com Web site.

        <p class="para" id="collins-ch13_s08_p27">Warren Buffett is the second-richest man in the world (behind Bill Gates) and a top investor in China’s stock market. As CEO of Berkshire Hathaway, a holding company with large stakes in a broad portfolio of investments, Buffett spends a lot of his time looking for companies with promising futures. His time has been quite well spent: the market price of a share in Berkshire Hathaway now tops $90,000—up from $16 a share in 1964.</p>
        <p class="para" id="collins-ch13_s08_p28">Among other things, Berkshire Hathaway owns two million shares in PetroChina, an energy firm 90 percent owned by the Chinese government. Surprised? To evaluate Buffett’s thinking in making such an investment, you’ll need to do a little research. First, find out something about the company by going to <a class="link" href="http://www.petrochina.com.cn/ptr">http://www.petrochina.com.cn/ptr</a> to link to the English version of the PetroChina Web site. Explore the sections “About PetroChina” and “Investor Relations.” Look for answers to the following questions:</p>
        <ol class="orderedlist" id="collins-ch13_s08_l11">
            <li>What does the company do? What products and services does it provide? How does it distribute its products?</li>

Enter the company’s stock symbol—PTR—and review the information provided on the site. To see what analysts think of the stock, for example, click on “Analyst Opinion.” (While you’re there, find out whether Berkshire Hathaway still owns stock in PetroChina—Berkshire Hathaway’s own stock isn’t up from $16 to $90,000 because Buffett tends to sit on his laurels.)</p>

            <li>If Berkshire Hathaway still owns stock in PetroChina, how many shares does it hold, and what’s their value?</li>
