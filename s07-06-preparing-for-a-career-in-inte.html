    <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch03_s06_p01">No matter where your career takes you, you won’t be able to avoid the reality and reach of international business. We’re all involved in it. Some readers may want to venture more seriously into this exciting arena. The career opportunities are exciting and challenging, but taking the best advantage of them requires some early planning. Here are some hints.</p>
    <div class="section" id="collins-ch03_s06_s01">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Plan Your Undergraduate Education</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch03_s06_s01_p01">Many colleges and universities offer strong majors in international business, and this course of study can be good preparation for a global career. In planning your education, remember the following:</p>
        <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="collins-ch03_s06_s01_l01">
            <li>
<em class="emphasis">Develop real expertise in one of the basic areas of business</em>. Most companies will hire you as much for your skill and knowledge in accounting, finance, information systems, marketing, or management as for your background in the study of international business. Take courses in both areas.</li>
            <li>
<em class="emphasis">Develop your knowledge of international politics, economics, and culture</em>. Take liberal arts courses that focus on parts of the world that especially interest you. Courses in history, government, and the social sciences offer a wealth of knowledge about other nations and cultures that’s relevant to success in international business.</li>
            <li>
<em class="emphasis">Develop foreign-language skills</em>. If you studied a language in high school, keep up with it. Improve your reading or conversational skills. Or start a new language in college. Recall that your competition in the global marketplace is not just other Americans, but also individuals from countries, such as Belgium, where everyone’s fluent in at least two (and usually three) languages. Lack of foreign-language skills often proves to be a disadvantage for many Americans in international business.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <div class="section" id="collins-ch03_s06_s02">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Get Some Direct Experience</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch03_s06_s02_p01">Take advantage of study-abroad opportunities, whether offered on your campus or by another college. There are literally hundreds of such opportunities, and your interest in international business will be received much more seriously if you’ve spent some time abroad. (As a bonus, you’ll probably find it an enjoyable, horizon-expanding experience, as well.)</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section" id="collins-ch03_s06_s03">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Interact with People from Other Cultures</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch03_s06_s03_p01">Finally, whenever you can, learn about the habits and traits of other cultures, and practice interacting with the people to whom they belong. Go to the trouble to meet international students on your campus and get to know them. Learn about their cultures and values, and tell them about yours. You may initially be uncomfortable or confused in such intercultural exchanges, but you’ll find them great learning experiences. By picking up on the details, you’ll avoid embarrassing mistakes later and even earn the approval of acquaintances from abroad.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch03_s06_s03_p02">Whether you’re committed to a career in global business, curious about the international scene, or simply a consumer of worldwide products and services, you can’t avoid the effects of globalization. Granted, the experience can be frustrating, maybe even troubling at times. More often, however, it’s likely to be stimulating and full of opportunities.</p>
