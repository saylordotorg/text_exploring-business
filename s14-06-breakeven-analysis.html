    <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch10_s06_p01">Forecasting sales of shoes has started you thinking. Selling twelve thousand pair of shoes the first year you run the business sounds great, but you still need to find an answer to the all-important question: are there enough customers willing to buy my jogging shoes at a price that will allow me to make a profit? Is there some way to figure out the level of sales I would need to avoid <em class="emphasis">losing</em> money—to “break even”? Fortunately, an accountant friend of yours informs you that there is. Not surprisingly, it’s called <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">breakeven analysis</a><span class="glossdef">Method of determining the level of sales at which the company will break even (have no profit or loss).</span></span>, and here’s how it works: to break even (have no profit or loss), <em class="emphasis">total sales revenue must exactly equal all your expenses (both variable and fixed)</em>. To determine the level of sales at which this will occur, you need to do the following:</p>
    <ol class="orderedlist editable block" id="collins-ch10_s06_l02">
        <li>
            <p class="para">Determine your total <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">fixed costs</a><span class="glossdef">Costs that don’t change when the amount of goods sold changes.</span></span>, which are so called because the total cost doesn’t change as the quantity of goods sold changes:</p>
            <ul class="itemizedlist" id="collins-ch10_s06_l03">
                <li>Fixed costs = $210,000 salaries + $60,000 rent + $10,000 advertising + $8,000 insurance + 12,000 other fixed costs = $300,000</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p class="para">Identify your <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">variable costs</a><span class="glossdef">Costs that vary, in total, as the quantity of goods sold changes but stay constant on a per-unit basis.</span></span>. These are costs that vary, in total, as the quantity of goods sold changes but that stay constant on a per-unit basis. State variable costs on a per-unit basis:</p>
            <ul class="itemizedlist" id="collins-ch10_s06_l04">
                <li>Variable cost per unit = $40 (cost of each pair of shoes) + $5 sales commission = $45</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p class="para">Determine your <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">contribution margin per unit</a><span class="glossdef">Excess of revenue per unit over variable cost per unit.</span></span>: selling price per unit less variable cost per unit:</p>
            <ul class="itemizedlist" id="collins-ch10_s06_l05">
                <li>Contribution margin per unit = $80 selling price minus $45 variable cost per unit = $35</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p class="para">Calculate your <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">breakeven point in units</a><span class="glossdef">Number of sales units at which net income is zero.</span></span>: fixed costs ÷ contribution margin per unit:</p>
            <ul class="itemizedlist" id="collins-ch10_s06_l06">
                <li>Breakeven in units = $300,000 fixed costs ÷ $35 contribution margin per unit = 8,571 units</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ol>
    <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch10_s06_p02">Your calculation means that if you sell 8,571 pairs of shoes, you will end up with zero profit (or loss) and will exactly break even.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch10_s06_p03">If your sales estimate is realistic (a big “if”), then you should be optimistic about starting the business. All your fixed costs will be covered once you sell 8,571 pairs of shoes. Any sales above that level will be pure profit. So, if you sell your expected level of twelve thousand pairs of shoes, you’ll make a profit of $120,015 for the first year. Here’s how we calculated that profit:</p>
    <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="collins-ch10_s06_l07">
        <li>12,000 expected sales level – 8,571 breakeven sales level = 3,429 units × $35 contribution margin per unit = $120,015 first-year profit</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch10_s06_p04">As you can see, breakeven analysis is pretty handy. It allows you to determine the level of sales that you must reach to avoid losing money and the profit you’ll make if you reach a higher sales goal. Such information will help you plan for your business.</p>

            <li>Breakeven analysis is a method of determining the level of sales at which the company will break even (have no profit or loss).</li>
            <li>The following information is used in calculating the breakeven point: fixed costs, variable costs, and contribution margin per unit.</li>
            <li>Fixed costs are costs that don’t change when the amount of goods sold changes. For example, rent is a fixed cost.</li>
            <li>Variable costs are costs that vary, in total, as the quantity of goods sold changes but stay constant on a per-unit basis. For example, sales commissions paid based on unit sales are a variable cost.</li>
            <li>Contribution margin per unit is the excess revenue per unit over the variable cost per unit.</li>
            <li>The breakeven point in units is calculated with this formula: fixed costs divided by contribution margin per unit (selling price per unit less variable cost per unit).</li>

You found a place you could rent that’s right next to a popular shopping center, and two of your friends (who are also dog groomers) have agreed to work for you. The problem is that you need to borrow money to start the business and your banker has asked for a breakeven analysis.
