    <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch01_s02_p01">A <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">business</a><span class="glossdef">Activity that provides goods or services to consumers for the purpose of making a profit.</span></span> is any activity that provides goods or services to consumers for the purpose of making a profit. When Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak created Apple Computer in Jobs’s family garage, they started a business. The product was the Apple I, and the company’s founders hoped to sell their computers to customers for more than it cost to make and market them. If they were successful (which they were), they’d make a <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">profit</a><span class="glossdef">Difference between the revenue that a company brings in from selling goods and services and the costs of generating this revenue.</span></span>.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch01_s02_p02">Before we go on, let’s make a couple of important distinctions concerning the terms in our definitions. First, whereas Apple produces and sells <em class="emphasis">goods</em> (iPhone, iPod, Mac), many businesses provide <em class="emphasis">services</em>. Your bank is a service company, as is your Internet provider. Airlines, law firms, movie theaters, and hospitals are also service companies. Many companies provide both goods and services. For example, your local car dealership sells goods (cars) and also provides services (automobile repairs).</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch01_s02_p03">Second, some organizations are not set up to make profits. Many are established to provide social or educational services. Such <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">not-for-profit (or nonprofit) organizations</a><span class="glossdef">Organization that has a purpose other than returning profits to owners.</span></span> include the United Way of America, Habitat for Humanity, the Boys and Girls Clubs, the Sierra Club, the American Red Cross, and many colleges and universities. Most of these organizations, however, function in much the same way as a business. They establish goals and work to meet them in an effective, efficient manner. Thus, most of the business principles introduced in this text also apply to nonprofits.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch01_s02_s01_p01">Let’s begin our discussion of business by identifying the main participants of business and the functions that most businesses perform. Then we’ll finish this section by discussing the external factors that influence a business’s activities.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch01_s02_s01_s01_p01">Every business must have one or more <em class="emphasis">owners</em> whose primary role is to invest money in the business. When a business is being started, it’s generally the owners who polish the business idea and bring together the resources (money and people) needed to turn the idea into a business. The owners also hire <em class="emphasis">employees</em> to work for the company and help it reach its goals. Owners and employees depend on a third group of participants—<em class="emphasis">customers</em>. Ultimately, the goal of any business is to satisfy the needs of its customers.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Functional Areas of Business</h2>

        <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch01_s02_s02_p01">The activities needed to operate a business can be divided into a number of <em class="emphasis">functional areas</em>: management, operations, marketing, accounting, and finance. Let’s briefly explore each of these areas.</p>

            <h2 class="title editable block">Management</h2>

Finally, managers design <em class="emphasis">controls</em> for assessing the success of plans and decisions and take corrective action when needed.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch01_s02_s02_s02_p01">All companies must convert resources (labor, materials, money, information, and so forth) into goods or services. Some companies, such as Apple, convert resources into <em class="emphasis">tangible</em> products—iPhones, iPods, Macs. Others, such as hospitals, convert resources into <em class="emphasis">intangible</em> products—health care. The person who designs and oversees the transformation of resources into goods or services is called an <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">operations manager</a><span class="glossdef">Person who designs and oversees the process that converts resources into goods or services.</span></span>.

They also decide on the best method of delivering products and the best means of promoting them to attract and keep customers. They manage relationships with customers and make them aware of the organization’s desire and ability to satisfy their needs.</p>

What should it do with its funds? What investments should be made in plant and equipment? How much should be spent on research and development? How should excess funds be invested? Good financial management is particularly important when a company is first formed, because new business owners usually need to borrow money to get started.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">External Forces That Influence Business Activities</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch01_s02_s03_p01">Apple and other businesses don’t operate in a vacuum: they’re influenced by a number of external factors. These include the economy, government, consumer trends, and public pressure to act as good corporate citizens. <a class="xref" href="#collins-ch01_s02_s02_s05_f01">Figure 1.3 "Business and Its Environment"</a> sums up the relationship among the participants in a business, its functional areas, and the external forces that influence its activities. One industry that’s clearly affected by all these factors is the fast food industry. A strong <em class="emphasis">economy</em> means people have more money to eat out at places where food standards are monitored by a <em class="emphasis">government</em> agency, the Food and Drug Administration. Preferences for certain types of foods are influenced by <em class="emphasis">consumer trends</em> (eating fried foods might be okay one year and out the next). Finally, a number of decisions made by the industry result from its <em class="emphasis">desire to be a good corporate citizen</em>. For example, several fast-food chains have responded to environmental concerns by eliminating Styrofoam containers.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-collins-fn01_010">David Baron, “Facing-Off in Public,” <em class="emphasis">Stanford Business</em>, April 15, 2006, <a class="link" href="http://www.gsb.stanford.edu/news/bmag/sbsm0308/feature_face_off.shtml">http://www.gsb.stanford.edu/news/bmag/sbsm0308/feature_face_off.shtml</a>.</span> As you move through this text, you’ll learn more about these external influences on business.
