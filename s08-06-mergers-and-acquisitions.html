The added employees will help the company expand its operations and market share of games for PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, and Wii. When properly executed, internal growth benefits the firm.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch04_s06_p02">An alternative approach to growth is to merge with or acquire another company. The rationale behind growth through merger or acquisition is that 1 + 1 = 3: the combined company is more valuable than the sum of the two separate companies. This rationale is attractive to companies facing competitive pressures. To grab a bigger share of the market and improve profitability, companies will want to become more cost efficient by combining with other companies.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch04_s06_s01_p01">Though they are often used as if they’re synonymous, the terms <em class="emphasis">merger</em> and <em class="emphasis">acquisition</em> mean slightly different things. A <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">merger</a><span class="glossdef">The combination of two companies to form a new company.</span></span> occurs when two companies combine to form a new company.

An example of a <em class="emphasis">merger</em> is the merging in 2005 of US Airways and America West. The combined company, the nation’s fifth largest carrier, flies under the US Airways name but is headquartered in Tempe, Arizona, the home of America West. It was hoped that the merger would help the combined airlines better compete with discount rivals Southwest and JetBlue.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-collins-fn04_010">Dan Reed and Barbara De Lollis, “America West, US Airways Merger Goes for a Tight Fit,” <em class="emphasis">USA Today</em>, May 19, 2005, <a class="link" href="http://www.usatoday.com/money/biztravel/2005-05-19-merger_x.htm">http://www.usatoday.com/money/biztravel/2005-05-19-merger_x.htm</a> (accessed June 20, 2008).</span> An example of a recent <em class="emphasis">acquisition</em> is the purchase of Reebok by Adidas for $3.8 billion.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-collins-fn04_011">Theresa Howard, “Adidas, Reebok lace up for run at Nike,” <em class="emphasis">US Today</em>, August 3, 2005, <a class="link" href="http://www.usatoday.com/money/industries/manufacturing/2005-08-02-adidas-usat_x.htm">http://www.usatoday.com/money/industries/manufacturing/2005-08-02-adidas-usat_x.htm</a> (accessed June 20, 2008).</span> The deal will give Adidas a stronger presence in North America and will help the company compete with rival Nike.

        <h2 class="title editable block">Motives behind Mergers and Acquisitions</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch04_s06_s02_p01">Companies are motivated to merge or acquire other companies for a number of reasons, including the following.</p>
        <div class="section" id="collins-ch04_s06_s02_s01">
            <h2 class="title editable block">Gain Complementary Products</h2>

            <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch04_s06_s02_s01_p01">Acquiring complementary products was the motivation behind Adidas’s acquisition of Reebok. As Adidas CEO Herbert Hainer stated in a conference call, “This is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. This is a perfect fit for both companies, because the companies are so complementary….Adidas is grounded in sports performance with such products as a motorized running shoe and endorsement deals with such superstars as British soccer player David Beckham. Meanwhile, Reebok plays heavily to the melding of sports and entertainment with endorsement deals and products by Nelly, Jay-Z, and 50 Cent. The combination could be deadly to Nike.”<span class="footnote" id="fwk-collins-fn04_012">Theresa Howard, “Adidas, Reebok lace up for run at Nike,” <em class="emphasis">US Today</em>, August 3, 2005, <a class="link" href="http://www.usatoday.com/money/industries/manufacturing/2005-08-02-adidas-usat_x.htm">http://www.usatoday.com/money/industries/manufacturing/2005-08-02-adidas-usat_x.htm</a> (accessed June 20, 2008).</span></p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch04_s06_s02_s02_p01">Gaining new markets was a significant factor in the merger of US Airways and America West. US Airways is a major player on the East Coast, the Caribbean and Europe, while America West is strong in the West. The expectations were that combining the two carriers would create an airline that could reach more markets than either carrier could do on its own.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-collins-fn04_013">“America West, US Air in Merger Deal,” CNNMoney.com, May 20, 2005, <a class="link" href="http://money.cnn.com/2005/05/19/news/midcaps/airlines/index.htm">http://money.cnn.com/2005/05/19/news/midcaps/airlines/index.htm</a> (accessed June 20, 2008).</span></p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch04_s06_s02_s03_p01">The purchase of Pharmacia Corporation (a Swedish pharmaceutical company) by Pfizer (a research-based pharmaceutical company based in the United States) in 2003 created the world’s largest drug maker and the leading pharmaceutical company, by revenue, in every major market around the globe. The acquisition created an industry giant with more than $48 billion in revenue and a research-and-development budget of more than $7 billion.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-collins-fn04_014">Robert Frank and Scott Hensley, “Pfizer to Buy Pharmacia For $60 Billion in Stock,” Wall Street Journal Online, WJS.com, July 15, 2002, <a class="link" href="http://www.chelationtherapyonline.com/technical/p39.htm">http://www.chelationtherapyonline.com/technical/p39.htm</a> (accessed June 20, 2008).</span> Each day, almost forty million people around the glove are treated with Pfizer medicines.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-collins-fn04_015">About Pfizer, company Web site: Pfizer.com, <a class="link" href="http://www.pfizer.com/about/history/pfizer_pharmacia.jsp">http://www.pfizer.com/about/history/pfizer_pharmacia.jsp</a> (accessed June 20, 2008).</span></p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Hostile Takeover</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch04_s06_s03_p01">What happens, though, if one company wants to acquire another company, but that company doesn’t want to be acquired? You can end up with a very unfriendly situation. The outcome could be a <em class="emphasis">hostile takeover</em>—an act of assuming control that’s resisted by the targeted company’s management and its board of directors. Ben Cohen and Jerry Greenfield found themselves in one of these unfriendly situations: Unilever—a very large Dutch/British company that owns three ice cream brands—wanted to buy Ben &amp; Jerry’s, against the founders’ wishes. To make matters worse, most of the Ben &amp; Jerry’s stockholders sided with Unilever. They had little confidence in the ability of Ben Cohen and Jerry Greenfield to continue managing the company and were frustrated with the firm’s social-mission focus. The stockholders liked Unilever’s offer to buy their Ben &amp; Jerry’s stock at almost twice its current market price and wanted to take their profits and run. In the end, Unilever won; Ben &amp; Jerry’s was acquired by Unilever in a hostile takeover. Despite fears that the company’s social mission would end, this didn’t happen. Though neither Ben Cohen nor Jerry Greenfield are involved in the current management of the company, they have returned to their social activism roots and are heavily involved in numerous social initiatives sponsored by the company.</p>
