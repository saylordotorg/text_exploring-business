        <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch13_s00_p01">How can you manage to combine a fantastic business idea, an efficient production system, a talented management team, and a creative marketing plan…and still go under? It’s not so hard if you don’t understand finance. Everyone in business—not finance specialists alone—needs to understand how the U.S. financial system operates and how financial decisions affect an organization. Businesspeople also need to know how securities markets work. In this chapter, we’ll discuss these three interrelated topics. Let’s start by taking a closer look at one of the key ingredients in any business enterprise—money.</p>

    </div>
    <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch13_s01_p01">Finance is about money. So our first question is, What is money? If you happen to have one on you, take a look at a $5 bill. What you’ll see is a piece of paper with a picture of Abraham Lincoln on one side and the Lincoln Memorial on the other. Though this piece of paper—indeed, money itself—has no intrinsic value, it’s certainly in demand. Why? Because money serves three basic functions. <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Money</a><span class="glossdef">Anything commonly accepted as a medium of exchange, measure of value, and store of value.</span></span> is the following:</p>
    <ol class="orderedlist editable block" id="collins-ch13_s01_l02">
        <li>A medium of exchange</li>
        <li>A measure of value</li>
        <li>A store of value</li>
    </ol>

    <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch13_s01_p02">To get a better idea of the role of money in a modern economy, let’s imagine a system in which there is no money. In this system, goods and services are <em class="emphasis">bartered</em>—traded directly for one another. Now, if you’re living and trading under such a system, for each barter exchange that you make, you’ll have to have something that another trader wants. For example, say you’re a farmer who needs help clearing his fields. Because you have plenty of food, you might enter into a barter transaction with a laborer who has time to clear fields but not enough food: he’ll clear your fields in return for three square meals a day.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch13_s01_p03">This system will work as long as two people have exchangeable assets, but needless to say, it can be inefficient. If we identify the functions of money, we’ll see how it improves the exchange for all the parties in our hypothetical set of transactions.</p>
    <div class="section" id="collins-ch13_s01_s01">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Medium of Exchange</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch13_s01_s01_p01">Money serves as a medium of exchange because people will accept it in exchange for goods and services. Because people can use money to buy the goods and services that they want, everyone’s willing to trade something for money. The laborer will take money for clearing your fields because he can use it to buy food. You’ll take money as payment for his food because you can use it not only to pay him, but also to buy something else you need (perhaps seeds for planting crops).</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch13_s01_s01_p02">For money to be used in this way, it must possess a few crucial properties:</p>
        <ol class="orderedlist editable block" id="collins-ch13_s01_s01_l01">
            <li>It must be <em class="emphasis">divisible</em>—easily divided into usable quantities or fractions. A $5 bill, for example, is equal to five $1 bills. If something costs $3, you don’t have to rip up a $5 bill; you can pay with three $1 bills.</li>
            <li>It must be <em class="emphasis">portable</em>—easy to carry; it can’t be too heavy or bulky.</li>
            <li>It must be <em class="emphasis">durable</em>. It must be strong enough to resist tearing and the print can’t wash off if it winds up in the washing machine.</li>
            <li>It must be <em class="emphasis">difficult to counterfeit</em>; it won’t have much value if people can make their own.</li>
        </ol>
    </div>
    <div class="section" id="collins-ch13_s01_s02">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Measure of Value</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch13_s01_s02_p01">Money simplifies exchanges because it serves as a measure of value. We state the price of a good or service in monetary units so that potential exchange partners know exactly how much value we want in return for it. This practice is a lot better than bartering because it’s much more precise than an ad hoc agreement that a day’s work in the field has the same value as three meals.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section" id="collins-ch13_s01_s03">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Store of Value</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch13_s01_s03_p01">Money serves as a store of value. Because people are confident that money keeps its value over time, they’re willing to save it for future exchanges. Under a bartering arrangement, the laborer earned three meals a day in exchange for his work. But what if, on a given day, he skipped a meal? Could he “save” that meal for another day? Maybe, but if he were paid in money, he could decide whether to spend it on food each day or save some of it for the future. If he wanted to collect on his “unpaid” meal two or three days later, the farmer might not be able to “pay” it; unlike money, food could go bad.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section" id="collins-ch13_s01_s04">
        <h2 class="title editable block">The Money Supply</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch13_s01_s04_p01">Now that we know what money does, let’s tackle another question: How much money is there? How would you go about “counting” all the money held by individuals, businesses, and government agencies in this country? You could start by counting the money that’s held to pay for things on a daily basis. This category includes <em class="emphasis">cash</em> (paper bills and coins) and funds held in <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">demand deposits</a><span class="glossdef">Checking accounts that pay given sums to “payees” when they demand them.</span></span>—checking accounts, which pay given sums to “payees” when they demand them.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch13_s01_s04_p02">Then, you might count the money that’s being “saved” for future use. This category includes <em class="emphasis">interest-bearing accounts, time deposits</em> (such as <em class="emphasis">certificates of deposit</em>, which pay interest after a designated period of time), and <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">money market mutual funds</a><span class="glossdef">Accounts that pay interest to investors who pool funds to make short-term loans to businesses and the government.</span></span>, which pay interest to investors who pool funds to make short-term loans to businesses and the government.</p>
        <div class="section" id="collins-ch13_s01_s04_s01">
            <h2 class="title editable block">M-1 and M-2</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch13_s01_s04_s01_p01">Counting all this money would be a daunting task (in fact, it would be impossible). Fortunately, there’s an easier way—namely, by examining two measures that the government compiles for the purpose of tracking the money supply: M-1 and M-2.</p>
            <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="collins-ch13_s01_s04_s01_l01">
                <li>The narrowest measure, <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">M-1</a><span class="glossdef">Measure of the money supply that includes only the most liquid forms of money, such as cash and checking-account funds.</span></span>, includes the most <em class="emphasis">liquid</em> forms of money—the forms, such as cash and checking-accounts funds, that are spent immediately.</li>
                <li>
<span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">M-2</a><span class="glossdef">Measure of the money supply that includes everything in M-1 plus near-cash.</span></span> includes everything in M-1 plus <em class="emphasis">near-cash items</em> invested for the short term—savings accounts, time deposits below $100,000, and money market mutual funds.</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch13_s01_s04_s01_p02">So what’s the bottom line? How much money <em class="emphasis">is</em> out there? To find the answer, you can go to the Federal Reserve Board Web site. The Federal Reserve reports that in December 2008, M-1 was about $1.6 trillion dollars and M-2 was $8.2 trillion. <a class="xref" href="#collins-ch13_s01_s04_s01_f01">Figure 13.2 "The U.S. Money Supply, 1980–2008"</a> shows the increase in the two money-supply measures since 1980.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch13_s01_s04_s01_p03">If you’re thinking that these numbers are too big to make much sense, you’re not alone. One way to bring them into perspective is to figure out how much money <em class="emphasis">you’d</em> get if all the money in the United States were redistributed equally. According to the U.S. Census Population Clock, there are 305,726,680 people in the United States. Your share of M-1, therefore, would be about $5,200 and your share of M-2 would be about $27,000.</p>

            <h2 class="title editable block">What, Exactly, Is “Plastic Money”?</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch13_s01_s04_s02_p01">Are credit cards a form of money? If not, why do we call them plastic money? Actually, when you buy something with a credit card, you’re not spending money. The principle of the credit card is buy-now-pay-later. In other words, when you use plastic, you’re taking out a loan that you intend to pay off when you get your bill. And the loan itself is not money. Why not? Basically because the credit card company can’t use the asset to buy anything. The loan is merely a promise of repayment. The asset doesn’t become money until the bill is paid (with interest). That’s why credit cards aren’t included in the calculation of M-1 and M-2.</p>

    <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch13_s02_p01">For financial transactions to happen, money must change hands. How do such exchanges occur? At any given point in time, some individuals, businesses, and government agencies have more money than they need for current activities; some have less than they need. Thus, we need a mechanism to match up savers (those with surplus money that they’re willing to lend out) with borrowers (those with deficits who want to borrow money). We could just let borrowers search out savers and negotiate loans, but the system would be both inefficient and risky. Even if you had a few extra dollars, would you lend money to a total stranger? If you needed money, would you want to walk around town looking for someone with a little to spare?</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch13_s02_s01_p01">Now you know why we have financial institutions: they act as intermediaries between savers and borrowers and they direct the flow of funds between them. With funds deposited by savers in checking, savings, and money market accounts, they make loans to individual and commercial borrowers. In the next section, we’ll discuss the most common types of depository institutions (banks that accept deposits), including <em class="emphasis">commercial banks, savings banks</em>, and <em class="emphasis">credit unions</em>. We’ll also discuss several nondepository institutions (which provide financial services but don’t accept deposits), including finance companies, insurance companies, brokerage firms, and pension funds.</p>

The country’s 7,500 commercial banks range in size from very large (Citigroup, Bank of America, J.P. Morgan Chase) to very small (local community banks). Because of mergers and financial problems, the number of banks has declined significantly in recent years, but, by the same token, surviving banks have grown quite large.

        <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch13_s02_s03_p01">How would you react if you put your life savings in a bank and then, when you went to withdraw it, learned that the bank had failed—that your money no longer existed? This is exactly what happened to many people during the Great Depression. In response to the crisis, the federal government established the <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Federal Depository Insurance Corporation (FDIC)</a><span class="glossdef">Government agency that regulates banks and insures deposits in its member banks up to $100,000.</span></span> in 1933 to restore confidence in the banking system. The FDIC insures deposits in commercial banks and savings banks up to $250,000. So today if your bank failed, the government would give you back your money (up to $250,000). The money comes from fees charged member banks.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch13_s02_s03_p02">To decrease the likelihood of failure, various government agencies conduct periodic examinations to ensure that institutions are in compliance with regulations. Commercial banks are regulated by the FDIC, savings banks by the Office of Thrift Supervision, and credit unions by the National Credit Union Administration. As we’ll see later in the chapter, the Federal Reserve System also has a strong influence on the banking industry.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Crisis in the Financial Industry (and the Economy)</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch13_s02_s04_p01">What follows is an interesting, but scary, story about the current financial crisis in the banking industry and its effect on the economy. In the years between 2001 and 2005, lenders made billions of dollars in subprime adjustable-rate mortgages (ARM) to American home buyers. Subprime loans are made to home buyers who don’t qualify for market-set interest rates because of one or more risk factors—income level, employment status, credit history, ability to make only a very low down payment. In 2006 and 2007, however, housing prices started to go down. Many homeowners with subprime loans, including those with ARMs whose rates had gone up, were neither able to refinance (to lower their interest rates) nor to borrow against their homes. Many of these homeowners got behind in mortgage payments, and foreclosures became commonplace—1.3 million in 2007 alone.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-collins-fn13_004">Justin Lahart, “Egg Cracks Differ in Housing, Finance Shells,” <em class="emphasis">Wall Street Journal</em>, July 13, 2008.</span> By April 2008, 1 in every 519 American households had received a foreclosure notice.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-collins-fn13_005">RealtyTrac Inc., “Foreclosure Activity Increases 4 Percent in April, <em class="emphasis">realtytrac.com</em>, May 14, 2008.</span> By August, 9.2 percent of the $12 trillion in U.S. mortgage loans was delinquent or in foreclosure.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-collins-fn13_006">Mortgage Bankers Association, “Delinquencies and Foreclosures Increase in Latest MBA National Delinquency Survey,” September 5, 2008, <a class="link" href="http://www.mbaa.org/NewsandMedia/PressCenter/64769.htm">http://www.mbaa.org/NewsandMedia/PressCenter/64769.htm</a> (accessed September 25, 2008); Charles Duhigg, “Loan-Agency Woes Swell from a Trickle to a Torrent,” <em class="emphasis">nytimes.com</em>, July 11, 2008, <a class="link" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/07/11/business/11ripple.html?ex=1373515200&amp;en=8ad220403fcfdf6e&amp;ei=5124&amp;partner=permalink&amp;exprod=permalink">http://www.nytimes.com/2008/07/11/business/11ripple.html?ex=1373515200&amp;en=8ad220403fcfdf6e&amp;ei=5124&amp;partner=permalink&amp;exprod=permalink</a>.</span></p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch13_s02_s04_p02">The repercussions? Banks and other institutions that made mortgage loans were the first sector of the financial industry to be hit. Largely because of mortgage-loan defaults, profits at more than 8,500 U.S. banks dropped from $35 billion in the fourth quarter of 2006 to $650 million in the corresponding quarter of 2007 (a decrease of 89 percent). Bank earnings for the year 2007 declined 31 percent and dropped another 46 percent in the first quarter of 2008.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-collins-fn13_007">Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, <em class="emphasis">Quarterly Banking Profile</em> (Fourth Quarter 2007), <a class="link" href="http://www.2.fdic.gov/qbp/2007dec/qbp.pdf">http://www.2.fdic.gov/qbp/2007dec/qbp.pdf</a> (accessed September 25, 2008); FDIC, <em class="emphasis">Quarterly Banking Profile</em> (First Quarter 2008), at <a class="link" href="http://www.2.fdic.gov/qbp/2008mar/qbp.pdf">http://www.2.fdic.gov/qbp/2008mar/qbp.pdf</a> (accessed September 25, 2008).</span></p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch13_s02_s04_p03">Losses in this sector were soon felt by two publicly traded government-sponsored organizations, the Federal National Mortgage Association (Fannie Mae) and the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (Freddie Mac). Both of these institutions are authorized to make loans and provide loan guarantees to banks, mortgage companies, and other mortgage lenders; their function is to make sure that these lenders have enough money to lend to prospective home buyers. Between them, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac backed approximately half of that $12 trillion in outstanding mortgage loans, and when the mortgage crisis hit, the stock prices of the two corporations began to drop steadily. In September 2008, amid fears that both organizations would run out of capital, the U.S. government took over their management.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch13_s02_s04_p04">Freddie Mac also had another function: to increase the supply of money available in the country for mortgage loans and new home purchases, Freddie Mac bought mortgages from banks, bundled these mortgages, and sold the bundles to investors (as mortgage-backed securities). The investors earned a return because they received cash from the monthly mortgage payments. The banks that originally sold the mortgages to Freddie Mac used the cash they got from the sale to make other loans. So investors earned a return, banks got a new influx of cash to make more loans, and individuals were able to get mortgages to buy the homes they wanted. This seemed like a good deal for everyone, so many major investment firms started doing the same thing: they bought individual subprime mortgages from original lenders (such as small banks), then pooled the mortgages and sold them to investors.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch13_s02_s04_p05">But then the bubble burst. When many home buyers couldn’t make their mortgage payments (and investors began to get less money and consequently their return on their investment went down), these mortgage-backed securities plummeted in value. Institutions that had invested in them—including investment banks—suffered significant losses.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-collins-fn13_008">Shawn Tully, “Wall Street’s Money Machine Breaks Down,” <em class="emphasis">Fortune</em>, <em class="emphasis">CNNMoney.com</em>, November 12, 2007, <a class="link" href="http://money.cnn.com/magazines/fortune/fortune_archive/2007/11/26/101232838/index.htm">http://money.cnn.com/magazines/fortune/fortune_archive/2007/11/26/101232838/index.htm</a> (accessed September 25, 2008).</span> In September 2008, one of these investment banks, Lehman Brothers, filed for bankruptcy protection; another, Merrill Lynch, agreed to sell itself for $50 billion. Next came American International Group (AIG), a giant insurance company that insured financial institutions against the risks they took in lending and investing money. As its policyholders buckled under the weight of defaulted loans and failed investments, AIG, too, was on the brink of bankruptcy, and when private efforts to bail it out failed, the U.S. government stepped in with a loan of $85 billion.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-collins-fn13_009">See Greg Robb et al., “AIG Gets Fed Rescue in Form of $85 Billion Loan,” <em class="emphasis">MarketWatch</em>, September 16, 2008, <a class="link" href="http://www.marketwatch.com/News/Story/aig-gets-fed-rescue-form/story.aspx?guid=%7BE84A4797%2D3EA6%2D40B1%2D9DB5%2DF07B5A7F5BC2%7D">http://www.marketwatch.com/News/Story/aig-gets-fed-rescue-form/story.aspx?guid=%7BE84A4797%2D3EA6%2D40B1%2D9DB5%2DF07B5A7F5BC2%7D</a> (accessed September 25, 2008).</span> The U.S. government also agreed to buy up risky mortgage-backed securities from teetering financial institutions at an estimated cost of “hundreds of billions.”<span class="footnote" id="fwk-collins-fn13_010">Mortgage Bankers Association, “Delinquencies and Foreclosures Increase in Latest MBA National Delinquency Survey,” Press Release, September 5, 2008, <a class="link" href="http://www.mbaa.org/NewsandMedia/PressCenter/64769.htm">http://www.mbaa.org/NewsandMedia/PressCenter/64769.htm</a> (accessed September 25, 2008).</span> And the banks started to fail—beginning with the country’s largest savings and loan, Washington Mutual, which had 2,600 locations throughout the country.

        <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch13_s02_s04_p06">The economic troubles that began in the banking industry as a result of the subprime crisis spread to the rest of the economy. Credit markets froze up and it became difficult for individuals and businesses to borrow money. Consumer confidence dropped, people stopped spending, businesses cut production, sales dropped, company profits fell, and many lost their jobs. It would be nice if this story had an ending (and even nicer if it was positive), but it might take us years before we know the ending. At this point in time, all we do know is that the economy is going through some very difficult times and no one is certain about the outcome.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">How Banks Expand the Money Supply</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch13_s02_s05_p01">When you deposit money, your bank doesn’t set aside a special pile of cash with your name on it. It merely records the fact that you made a deposit and increases the balance in your account. Depending on the type of account, you can withdraw your share whenever you want, but until then, it’s added to all the other money held by the bank. Because the bank can be pretty sure that all its depositors won’t withdraw their money at the same time, it holds on to only a fraction of the money that it takes in—its <em class="emphasis">reserves</em>. It lends out the rest to individuals, businesses, and the government, earning interest income and expanding the money supply.</p>
        <div class="section" id="collins-ch13_s02_s05_s01">
            <h2 class="title editable block">The Money Multiplier</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch13_s02_s05_s01_p01">Precisely how do banks expand the money supply? To find out, let’s pretend you win $10,000 at the blackjack tables of your local casino. You put your winnings into your savings account immediately. The bank will keep a fraction of your $10,000 in reserve; to keep matters simple, we’ll use 10 percent. The bank’s reserves, therefore, will increase by $1,000 ($10,000 × 0.10). It will then lend out the remaining $9,000. The borrowers (or the parties to whom they pay it out) will then deposit the $9,000 in their own banks. Like your bank, these banks will hold onto 10 percent of the money ($900) and lend out the remainder ($8,100). Now let’s go through the process one more time. The borrowers of the $8,100 (or, again, the parties to whom they pay it out) will put this amount into their banks, which will hold onto $810 and lend the remaining $7,290. As you can see in <a class="xref" href="#collins-ch13_s02_s05_s01_f01">Figure 13.4 "The Effect of the Money Multiplier"</a>, total bank deposits would now be $27,100. Eventually, bank deposits would increase to $100,000, bank reserves to $10,000, and loans to $90,000. A shortcut for arriving at these numbers depends on the concept of the <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">money multiplier</a><span class="glossdef">The amount by which an initial bank deposit will expand the money supply.</span></span>, which is determined using the following formula:</p>
            <span class="informalequation block"><span class="mathphrase">Money multiplier = 1/Reserve requirement</span></span>
            <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch13_s02_s05_s01_p02">In our example, the money multiplier is 1/0.10 = 10. So your initial deposit of $10,000 expands into total deposits of $100,000 ($10,000 × 10), additional loans of $90,000 ($9,000 × 10), and increased bank reserves of $10,000 ($1,000 × 10). In reality, the multiplier will actually be less than 10. Why? Because some of the money loaned out will be held as currency and won’t make it back into the banks.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch13_s03_s01_p02">Recall our definition of <em class="emphasis">monetary policy</em> in <a class="xref" href="collins-ch01#collins-ch01">Chapter 1 "The Foundations of Business"</a> as the efforts of the Federal Reserve System to regulate the nation’s money supply. We also defined <em class="emphasis">price stability</em> as conditions under which the prices for products remain fairly constant. Now, we can put the two concepts together: the Fed seeks to stabilize prices by regulating the money supply and interest rates. In turn, stable prices promote economic growth and full employment—at least in theory. To conduct monetary policy, the Fed relies on three tools: <em class="emphasis">reserve requirements</em>, the <em class="emphasis">discount rate</em>, and <em class="emphasis">open market operations</em>.</p>
        <div class="section" id="collins-ch13_s03_s01_s01">
            <h2 class="title editable block">Reserve Requirements</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch13_s03_s01_s01_p01">Under what circumstances would the Fed want to change the reserve requirement for banks? The purpose of controlling the money supply is primarily to lessen the threat of <em class="emphasis">inflation</em> (a rise in the overall price level) or <em class="emphasis">recession</em> (an economic slowdown gauged by a decline in gross domestic product). Here’s how it works (again, in theory). If the Fed <em class="emphasis">raises</em> the reserve requirement (for example, from 10 percent to 11 percent), banks must set aside more money. Consequently, they have <em class="emphasis">less to lend</em> and so raise their interest rates. Under these conditions, it’s harder and more expensive for people to borrow money, and if they can’t borrow as much, they can’t spend as much, and if people don’t spend as much, prices don’t go up. Thus, the Fed has lessened the likelihood of inflation.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch13_s03_s01_s01_p02">Conversely, when the Fed <em class="emphasis">lowers</em> the reserve requirement (for example, from 10 percent to 9 percent), banks need to set aside less money. Because they have <em class="emphasis">more money to lend</em>, they keep interest rates down. Borrowers find it easier and cheaper to get money for buying things, and the more consumers buy, the higher prices go. In this case, the Fed has reduced the likelihood of a recession.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch13_s03_s01_s01_p03">A 1 percent change in the reserve requirement, whether up to 11 percent or down to 9 percent, may not seem like much, but remember our earlier discussion of the <em class="emphasis">money multiplier</em>: because of the money-multiplier effect, a small change in the reserve requirement has a dramatic effect on the money supply.

            <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch13_s03_s01_s02_p01">To understand how the Fed uses the discount rate to control the money supply, let’s return to our earlier discussion of reserves. Recall that banks must keep a certain fraction of their deposits as reserves. The bank can hold these reserve funds or deposit them into a Federal Reserve Bank account. Recall, too, that the bank can lend out any funds that it doesn’t have to put on reserve. What happens if a bank’s reserves fall below the required level? The Fed steps in, permitting the bank to “borrow” reserve funds from the Federal Reserve Bank and add them to its reserve account at the Bank. There’s a catch: the bank must pay interest on the borrowed money. The rate of interest that the Fed charges member banks is called the <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">discount rate</a><span class="glossdef">Rate of interest the Fed charges member banks when they borrow reserve funds.</span></span>. By manipulating this rate, the Fed can make it appealing or unappealing to borrow funds. If the rate is high enough, banks will be reluctant to borrow. Because they don’t want to drain their reserves, they cut back on lending. The money supply, therefore, decreases. By contrast, when the discount rate is low, banks are more willing to borrow because they’re less concerned about draining their reserves. Holding fewer excess reserves, they lend out a higher percentage of their funds, thereby increasing the money supply.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch13_s03_s01_s02_p02">Even more important is the carryover effect of a change in the discount rate to the overall level of interest rates.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-collins-fn13_012">Robert Heilbroner and Lester Thurow, <em class="emphasis">Economics Explained</em> (New York: Simon &amp; Schuster, 1998), 134.</span> When the Fed adjusts the discount rate, it’s telling the financial community where it thinks the economy is headed—up or down. Wall Street, for example, generally reacts unfavorably to an increase in the discount rate. Why? Because the increase means that interest rates will probably rise, making future borrowing more expensive.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch13_s03_s01_s04_p01">In conducting open market operations, the Fed is trying to do the same thing that it does in using its other tools—namely, to influence the money supply and, thereby, interest rates. But it also has something else in mind. To understand what that is, you need to know a few more things about banking. When a bank’s reserve falls below its required level, it may, as we’ve seen, borrow from the Fed (at the discount rate). But it can also borrow from other member banks that have excess reserves. The rate that banks pay when they borrow through this channel is called the <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">federal funds rate</a><span class="glossdef">The interest rate that a Federal Reserve member bank pays when it borrows from other member banks to meet reserve requirements.</span></span>.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-collins-fn13_013">Federal Reserve System, “Monetary Policy FAQs,” FED101, <a class="link" href="http://www.federalreserveeducation.org/fed101_html/policy/basics_print.htm">http://www.federalreserveeducation.org/fed101_html/policy/basics_print.htm</a> (accessed May 30, 2006).</span></p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch13_s03_s01_s04_p02">How does the federal funds rate affect the money supply? As we’ve seen, when the Fed sells bonds in the open market, the reserve balances of many member banks go down. To get their reserves back to the required level, they must borrow, whether from the Fed or from other member banks. When Bank 1 borrows from Bank 2, Bank 2’s supply of funds goes down; thus, it increases the interest rate that it charges. In short, the increased demand for funds drives up the federal funds rate.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch13_s03_s01_s04_p03">All this interbank borrowing affects you, the average citizen and consumer. When the federal funds rate goes up, banks must pay more for their money, and they’ll pass the cost along to their customers: banks all over the country will raise the interest rates charged on mortgages, car loans, and personal loans. <a class="xref" href="#collins-ch13_s03_s01_s04_f01">Figure 13.6 "Key Interest Rates, 1995–2008"</a> charts ten-year fluctuations in the discount rate, federal funds rate, and <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">prime rate</a><span class="glossdef">Rate that banks charge their best customers.</span></span>—the rate that banks charge their best customers. Because all three rates tend to move in the same direction, borrowers—individuals, as well as organizations—generally pay more to borrow money when banks have to pay more and less when banks have to pay less. Notice that the prime rate (which banks charge their customers) is higher than both the federal funds and discount rates (which banks must pay when they need to borrow). That’s why banks make profits when they make loans. Note, too, that the Fed lowered the discount rate and federal funds rate drastically in 2008 in an attempt to stimulate a weakening economy.</p>

When you get a check, you deposit it in your checking account, thereby increasing your balance. When you pay someone by check, the dollar amount of the check is charged to your account, and your balance goes down.

In <a class="xref" href="collins-ch01#collins-ch01">Chapter 1 "The Foundations of Business"</a>, we defined <em class="emphasis">finance</em> as all the activities involved in planning for, obtaining, and managing a company’s funds.

        <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch13_s04_s01_p01">Because new businesses usually need to borrow money in order to get off the ground, good financial management is particularly important to start-ups. Let’s suppose that you’re about to start up a company that you intend to run from your dorm room. You thought of the idea while rummaging through a pile of previously worn clothes to find something that wasn’t about to get up and walk to the laundry all by itself. “Wouldn’t it be great,” you thought, “if there was an on-campus laundry service that would come and pick up my dirty clothes and bring them back to me washed and folded.” Because you were also in the habit of running out of cash at inopportune times, you were highly motivated to start some sort of money-making enterprise, and the laundry service seemed to fit the bill (even though washing and folding clothes wasn’t among your favorite activities—or skills).</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch13_s04_s02_s01_p01">Fortunately, you can draw on your newly acquired accounting skills to prepare the first section—the one in which you’ll specify the amount of cash you need. You start by estimating your <em class="emphasis">sales</em> (or, in your case, revenue from laundering clothes) for your first year of operations. This is the most important estimate you’ll make: without a realistic sales estimate, you can’t accurately calculate equipment needs and other costs. To predict sales, you’ll need to estimate two figures:</p>
            <ol class="orderedlist editable block" id="collins-ch13_s04_s02_s01_l01">
                <li>The number of loads of laundry that you’ll handle</li>
                <li>The price that you’ll charge per load</li>
            </ol>
            <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch13_s04_s02_s01_p02">You calculate as follows: You estimate that 5 percent of the ten thousand students on campus will use the service. These five hundred students will have one large load of laundry for each of the thirty-five weeks that they’re on campus. Therefore, you’ll do 17,500 loads (500 × 35 = 17,500 loads). You decide to price each load at $10. At first, this seemed high, but when you consider that you’ll have to pick up, wash, dry, fold, and return large loads, it seems reasonable.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch13_s04_s02_s01_p03">Perhaps more important, when you projected your costs—including salaries (for some student workers), rent, utilities, depreciation on equipment and a truck, supplies, maintenance, insurance, and advertising—you found that each load would cost $8, leaving a profit of $2 per load and earning you $35,000 for your first year (which is worth your time, though not enough to make you rich).</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch13_s04_s02_s01_p04">What things will you have to buy in order to get started? Using your estimate of sales, you’ve determined that you’d need the following:</p>

                <li>Five washers and five dryers</li>
                <li>A truck to pick up and deliver the clothes (a used truck will do for now)</li>
                <li>An inventory of laundry detergent and other supplies, such as laundry baskets</li>
                <li>Rental space in a nearby building (which will need some work to accommodate a laundry)</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch13_s04_s02_s01_p05">And, you’ll need cash—cash to carry you over while the business gets going and cash with which to pay your bills. Finally, you’d better have some extra money for contingencies—things you don’t expect, such as a machine overflowing and damaging the floor. You’re mildly surprised to find that your cash needs total $33,000. Your next task is to find out where you can get $33,000. In the next section, we’ll look at some options.</p>

A <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">short-term loan</a><span class="glossdef">Loan issued with a maturity date of less than one year.</span></span> is for less than a year, an <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">intermediate loan</a><span class="glossdef">Loan issued with a maturity date of one to five years.</span></span> for one to five years, and a <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">long-term loan</a><span class="glossdef">Loan issued with a maturity date of five years or more.</span></span> for five years or more.

            <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch13_s04_s03_s04_p02">In taking out a loan, you want to match its term with its purpose. If, for example, you’re borrowing money to buy a truck that you plan to use for five years, you’d request a five-year loan. On the other hand, if you’re financing a piece of equipment that you’ll use for ten years, you’ll want a ten-year loan. For short-term needs, like buying inventory, you may request a one-year loan.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch13_s04_s03_s04_p03">With any loan, however, you must consider the ability of the business to repay it. If you expect to lose money for the first year, you obviously won’t be able to repay a one-year loan on time. You’d be better off with intermediate or long-term financing. Finally, you need to consider <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">amortization</a><span class="glossdef">Schedule by which you’ll reduce the balance of your debt.</span></span>—the schedule by which you’ll reduce the balance of your debt. Will you be making periodic payments on both principal and interest over the life of the loan (for example, monthly or quarterly), or will the entire amount (including interest) be due at the end of the loan period?</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch13_s04_s03_s05_p01">A bank won’t lend you money unless it thinks that your business can generate sufficient funds to pay it back. Often, however, the bank takes an added precaution by asking you for <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">security</a><span class="glossdef">Collateral pledged to secure repayment of a loan.</span></span>—business or personal assets, called <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">collateral</a><span class="glossdef">Specific business or personal assets that a bank accepts as security for a loan.</span></span>, that you pledge in order to guarantee repayment. You may have to secure the loan with company assets, such as inventory or accounts receivable, or even with personal assets. (Likewise, if you’re an individual getting a car loan, the bank will accept the automobile as security.) In any case, the principle is pretty simple: if you don’t pay the loan when it’s due, the bank can take possession of the collateral, sell it, and keep the proceeds to cover the loan. If you don’t have to put up collateral, you’re getting an <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">unsecured loan</a><span class="glossdef">Loan given by a bank that doesn’t require the borrower to put up collateral.</span></span>, but because of the inherent risk entailed by new business ventures, banks don’t often make such loans.</p>

The rate of interest charged on a loan varies with several factors—the general level of interest rates, the size of the loan, the quality of the collateral, and the debt-paying ability of the borrower. For smaller, riskier loans, it can be as much as 6 to 8 percentage points above the prime rate—the rate that banks charge their most creditworthy borrowers. It’s currently around 5 percent per year.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Making the Financing Decision</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch13_s04_s04_p01">Now that we’ve surveyed your options, let’s go back to the task of financing your laundry business. You’d like to put up a substantial amount of the money you need, but you can only come up with a measly $1,000 (which you had to borrow on your credit card). You were, however, able to convince your parents to lend you $10,000, which you’ve promised to pay back, with interest, in three years. (They were wavering until you pointed out that Fred DeLuca started SUBWAY as a way of supporting himself through college).</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch13_s04_s04_p02">So you still need $22,000 ($33,000 minus the $11,000 from you and your parents). You talked with someone at the Small Business Development Center located on campus, but you’re not optimistic about getting them to guarantee a loan. Instead, you put together a sound business plan, including projected financial statements, and set off to your local banker. To your surprise, she agreed to a five-year loan at a reasonable interest rate. Unfortunately, she wanted the entire loan secured. Because you’re using some of the loan money to buy washers and dryers (for $15,000) and a truck (for $6,000), you can put up these as collateral. You have no accounts receivable or inventories, so you agreed to put up some personal assets—namely, the shares of Microsoft stock that you got as a high-school graduation present (now worth about $5,000).</p>

Now you’re serving five colleges and some three thousand customers a week. Your management team has expanded, but you’re still in charge of the company’s finances.

        <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch13_s04_s06_p01">So far, you’ve been able to finance your company’s growth through internally generated funds—profits retained in the business—along with a few bank loans. Your success, especially your expansion to other campuses, has confirmed your original belief that you’ve come up with a great business concept. You’re anxious to expand further, but to do that, you’ll need a substantial infusion of new cash. You’ve poured most of your profits back into the company, and your parents can’t lend you any more money. After giving the problem some thought, you realize that you have three options:</p>
        <ol class="orderedlist editable block" id="collins-ch13_s04_s06_l01">
            <li>Ask the bank for more money.</li>
            <li>Bring in additional owners who can invest in the company.</li>
            <li>Seek funds from a private investor.</li>

        <div class="section" id="collins-ch13_s04_s06_s01">
            <h2 class="title editable block">Angels and Venture Capitalists</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch13_s04_s06_s01_p01">Eventually, you decide on the third option. First, however, you must decide what type of private investor you want—an “angel” or a venture capitalist. <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Angels</a><span class="glossdef">Wealthy individual willing to invest in start-up ventures.</span></span> are usually wealthy individuals willing to invest in start-up ventures they believe will succeed.

            <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch13_s04_s06_s01_p02">There are drawbacks. Both types of private investors provide business expertise, as well as financing, and, in effect, both become partners in the enterprises that they finance. They accept only the most promising opportunities, and if they do decide to invest in your business, they’ll want something in return for their money—namely, a say in how you manage it.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch13_s04_s06_s01_p03">When you approach private investors, you can be sure that your business plan will get a thorough going-over. Under your current business model, setting up a new laundry on another campus requires about $50,000. But you’re a little more ambitious, intending to increase the number of colleges that you serve from five to twenty-five. So you’ll need a cash inflow of $1 million. On weighing your alternatives and considering the size of the loan you need, you decide to approach a venture capitalist. Fortunately, because you prepared an excellent business plan and made a great presentation, your application was accepted. Your expansion begins.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Going Public</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch13_s04_s07_p01">Fast-forward another five years. You’ve worked hard (and been lucky), and even finished your degree in finance. Moreover, your company has done amazingly well, with operations at more than five hundred colleges in the Northeast. You’ve financed continued strong growth with a combination of venture-capital funds and internally generated funds (that is, reinvested earnings).</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch13_s04_s07_p02">Up to this point, you’ve operated as a private corporation with limited stock ownership (you and your parents are the sole shareholders). But because you expect your business to prosper even more and grow even bigger, you’re thinking about the possibility of selling stock to the public for the first time. The advantages are attractive: not only would you get a huge influx of cash, but because it would come from the sale of stock rather than from borrowing, it would also be interest free and you wouldn’t have to repay it. Again there are some drawbacks. For one thing, going public is quite costly—often exceeding $300,000—and time-consuming. Second, from this point on, your financial results would be public information. Finally, you’d be responsible to shareholders who will want to see the kind of short-term performance results that boosts stock prices.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch13_s04_s07_p03">After weighing the pros and cons, you decide to go ahead. The first step in the process of becoming a public corporation is called an <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">initial public offering (IPO)</a><span class="glossdef">Process of taking a privately held company public by selling stock to the public for the first time.</span></span>, and you’ll need the help of an <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">investment banking firm</a><span class="glossdef">Financial institution that specializes in issuing securities.</span></span>—a financial institution (such as Goldman Sachs or Morgan Stanley) that specializes in issuing securities.

For one thing, without a realistic estimate of your revenue, you can’t accurately calculate your costs. Say, for example, that you just bought a condominium in Hawaii, which you plan to rent out to vacationers. Because you live in snowy New England, however, you plan to use it yourself from December 15 to January 15. You’ve also promised your sister that she can have it for the month of July. Now, in Hawaii, condo rents peak during the winter and summer seasons—December 15 to April 15, and June 15 to August 31. They also vary from island to island, according to age and quality, number of rooms, and location (on the beach or away from it). The good news is that your relatively new two-bedroom condo is on a glistening beach in Maui. The bad news is that no one is fortunate enough to keep a condo rented for the entire time that it’s available. What information would you need to estimate your rental revenues for the year?</p>

    </div>
    <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch13_s06_p01">Let’s assume that taking your company public was a smart move: in posing questions like those that we’ve just listed, investors have decided that your business is a good buy. With the influx of investment capital, the little laundry business that you started in your dorm ten years ago has grown into a very large operation with laundries at more than seven hundred colleges all across the country, and you’re opening two or three laundries a week. But there’s still a huge untapped market out there, and you’ve just left a meeting with your board of directors at which it was decided that you’ll seek additional funding for further growth. Everyone agrees that you need about $8 million for the proposed expansion, yet there’s a difference of opinion among your board members on how to go about getting it. You have two options:</p>
    <ol class="orderedlist editable block" id="collins-ch13_s06_l02">
        <li>
<span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Equity financing</a><span class="glossdef">Process of raising capital for a company through the sale of stock.</span></span>: raising the needed capital through the sale of stock</li>

    </ol>
    <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch13_s06_p02">Let’s review some of the basics underlying your options.</p>
    <div class="section" id="collins-ch13_s06_s01">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Stock</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch13_s06_s01_p01">If you decide to sell stock to finance your expansion, the proceeds from the sale will increase your <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">stockholders’ equity</a><span class="glossdef">Amount invested in a corporation by its shareholders.</span></span>—the amount invested in the business by its owners (which is the same thing that we called <em class="emphasis">owner’s equity</em> in <a class="xref" href="collins-ch12#collins-ch12">Chapter 12 "The Role of Accounting in Business"</a>). In general, an increase in stockholders’ equity is good. Your <em class="emphasis">assets</em>—specifically, your cash—will increase because you’ll have more money with which to expand and operate your business (which is also good). But if you sell additional shares of stock, you’ll have more stockholders—a situation that, as we’ll see later, isn’t always good.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section" id="collins-ch13_s06_s02">
        <h2 class="title editable block">The Risk/Reward Trade-Off</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch13_s06_s02_p01">To issue additional shares of stock, you’ll need to find buyers interested in purchasing them. You need to ask yourself this question: Why would anyone want to buy stock in your company? Stockholders, as we know, are part owners of the company and, as such, share in the risks and rewards associated with ownership. If your company does well, they may benefit through <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">dividends</a><span class="glossdef">Earnings distributed to stockholders.</span></span>—distributed earnings—or through appreciation in the value of their stock, or both. If your company does poorly, the value of their stock will probably decline. Because the risk/reward trade-off varies according to the type of stock—<em class="emphasis">common</em> or <em class="emphasis">preferred</em>—we need to know a little more about the difference between the two.</p>
        <div class="section" id="collins-ch13_s06_s02_s01">
            <h2 class="title editable block">Common Stock</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch13_s06_s02_s01_p01">Holders of <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">common stock</a><span class="glossdef">Stock whose owners bear the ultimate rewards and risks of ownership.</span></span> bear the ultimate rewards and risks of ownership. Depending on the extent of their ownership, they could exercise some control over the corporation. They’re generally entitled to vote on members of the board of directors and other important matters. If the company does well, they benefit more than holders of preferred stock; if it does poorly, they take a harder hit. If it goes out of business, they’re the last to get any money from the sale of what’s left and can in fact lose their investments entirely.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch13_s06_s02_s01_p02">So who would buy common stock? It’s a good option for individuals and institutions that are willing to take an investment roller-coaster ride: for a chance to share in the growth and profits of a company (the ups), they have to be willing to risk losing all or part of their investments (the downs).</p>
        </div>
        <div class="section" id="collins-ch13_s06_s02_s02">
            <h2 class="title editable block">Preferred Stock</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch13_s06_s02_s02_p01"><span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Preferred stock</a><span class="glossdef">Stock that pays owners a fixed dividend annually.</span></span> is safer, but it doesn’t have the upside potential. Unlike holders of common stock, whose return on investment depends on the company’s performance, preferred shareholders receive a fixed dividend every year. As usual, there are disadvantages and advantages. They don’t usually have voting rights, and unless the company does extremely well, their dividends are limited to the fixed amount. On the other hand, they’re <em class="emphasis">preferred</em> as to dividends: the company can pay no dividends to common shareholders until it’s paid all preferred dividends. If the company goes under, preferred stockholders also get their money back before common shareholders get any of theirs. In many ways, they’re more like creditors than investors in equity: though they can usually count on a fixed, relatively safe income, they have little opportunity to share in a company’s success.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="section" id="collins-ch13_s06_s02_s03">
            <h2 class="title editable block">Cumulative and Convertible Preferred Stock</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch13_s06_s02_s03_p01">There are a couple of ways to make preferred stock more attractive. With <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">cumulative preferred stock</a><span class="glossdef">Preferred stock that requires a corporation to pay all current and missed preferred dividends before it can pay common dividends.</span></span>, if a company fails to make a dividend payment to preferred shareholders in a given year, it can pay no common dividends until preferred shareholders have been <em class="emphasis">paid in full for both current and missed dividends</em>. Anyone holding <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">convertible preferred stock</a><span class="glossdef">Preferred stock that gives its owner the option of exchanging it for common stock.</span></span> may exchange it for common stock. Thus, preferred shareholders can convert to common stock when and if the company’s performance is strong—when its common stock is likely to go up in value.</p>
        </div>
    </div>
    <div class="section" id="collins-ch13_s06_s03">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Bonds</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch13_s06_s03_p01">Now, let’s look at the second option: debt financing—raising capital through the sale of bonds. As with the sale of stock, the sale of bonds will increase your assets (again, specifically your cash) because you’ll receive an inflow of cash (which, as we said, is good). But as we’ll see, your <em class="emphasis">liabilities</em>—your debt to outside parties—will also increase (which is bad). And just as you’ll need to find buyers for your stock, you’ll need to find buyers for your bonds. Again, we need to ask the question: Why would anyone want to buy your company’s bonds?</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch13_s06_s03_p02">Your financial projections show that you need $8 million to finance your expansion. If you decide to borrow this much money, you aren’t likely to find one individual or institution that will loan it to you. But if you divided up the $8 million loan into eight thousand smaller loans of $1,000 each, you’d stand a better chance of getting the amount you need. That’s the strategy behind issuing <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">bonds</a><span class="glossdef">Debt securities that require annual interest payments to bondholders.</span></span>: debt securities that obligate the issuer to make interest payments to bondholders (generally on a periodic basis) and to repay the principal when the bond matures. In other words, a bond is an IOU that pays interest. Like equity investors, bondholders can sell their securities on the financial market.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch13_s06_s03_p03">From the investor’s standpoint, buying bonds is a way to earn a fairly good rate of return on money that he or she doesn’t need for a while. The interest is better than what they’d get on a savings account or in a money market fund. But there is some risk. Investors who are interested in your bonds will assess the financial strength of your company: they want to feel confident that you’ll be able to make your interest payments and pay back the principal when the time comes. They’ll probably rely on data supplied by such bond-rating organizations as Moody’s and Standard &amp; Poor’s, which rate bonds from AAA (highly unlikely to default) to D (in default).</p>
        <div class="section" id="collins-ch13_s06_s03_s01">
            <h2 class="title editable block">Treasuries and Munis</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch13_s06_s03_s01_p01">Remember, too, that if you decide to issue bonds, you’ll be competing with other borrowers, including state and local governments and the federal government. In fact, the U.S. government, which issues bonds through the Treasury Department, is the country’s largest debtor. <em class="emphasis">Treasury bills</em>, for example, mature in one year, <em class="emphasis">Treasury notes</em> in one to ten years, and <em class="emphasis">Treasury bonds</em> in more than ten years. State and local governments issue bonds (often called <em class="emphasis">munis</em>, for “municipals”) to support public services such as schools and roads or special projects. Both treasuries and munis are attractive because the income earned on them is generally tax free at the state and local levels.</p>
        </div>
    </div>
    <div class="section" id="collins-ch13_s06_s04">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Choosing Your Financing Method</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch13_s06_s04_p01">Let’s say that after mulling over your money-raising options—equity financing versus debt financing—you decide to recommend to the board that the company issue common stock to finance its expansion. How do you explain your decision? Issuing bonds is an attractive option because it won’t dilute your ownership, but you don’t like the idea of repaying interest-bearing loans: at this point, you’re reluctant to take on any future financial obligation, and money obtained through the sale of stock doesn’t have to be paid back. Granted, adding additional shareholders will force you to relinquish some ownership interest: new shareholders will vote on your board of directors and could have some influence over major decisions. On balance, you prefer the option of selling stock—specifically, common stock. Why not preferred stock? Because it has drawbacks similar to those of debt financing: you’d have to make periodic dividend payments, requiring an outflow of cash. Once the matter has been settled, you take a well-deserved vacation. Unfortunately, you can’t stop thinking about what you’ll do the next time you want to expand. In particular, franchising seems to be a particularly attractive idea. It’s something you’ll need to research when you get a chance.</p>

    </div>
    <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch13_s07_p01">A financial career path offers a number of interesting, entry-level jobs that can develop into significant senior-level positions. In addition to a strong finance education, you’ll need to be familiar with both accounting and economics. Along with possessing strong analytical skills and the ability to assess financial data, you’ll need to work effectively with colleagues throughout an organization. So you’ll need good interpersonal and communication skills: you’ll have to write and speak clearly and, in particular, you’ll have to be able to present complex financial data in terms that everyone can understand.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch13_s07_p02">Generally, most positions in finance fall into one of three broad areas: <em class="emphasis">commercial banking, corporate finance</em>, and the <em class="emphasis">investment industry</em>.</p>
    <div class="section" id="collins-ch13_s07_s01">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Positions in Commercial Banking</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch13_s07_s01_p01">Commercial banks employ finance professionals as loan officers to work with clients requesting personal or business loans. It’s the borrower’s responsibility, of course, to present a clear and coherent application, and it’s the loan officer who evaluates it—who decides whether the borrower will be able to meet the terms of the loan. Finance professionals also manage the deposits made at commercial banks, providing the bank with additional revenue by investing funds that don’t go into loans.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section" id="collins-ch13_s07_s02">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Positions in Corporate Finance</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch13_s07_s02_p01">Every organization needs financial expertise. Large companies need finance professionals to manage their cash, their debt requirements, and their pension investments. They’re responsible for securing capital (whether through debt or equity), and they may be called on for any of the following tasks:</p>
        <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="collins-ch13_s07_s02_l01">
            <li>Analyzing industry trends</li>
            <li>Evaluating corporate investment in new plants, equipment, or products</li>
            <li>Conducting financial planning</li>
            <li>Evaluating acquisitions (deciding, for example, whether to buy another company)</li>
            <li>Reviewing the financial needs of top management</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch13_s07_s02_p02">In smaller firms, all these tasks may fall to a single finance professional. In addition, both large and small companies may occasionally use the services of financial consultants. They may be provided by investment bankers, by specialized consulting firms, or by the financial-advisory departments of a major accounting firm.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch13_s07_s02_p03">From an entry-level position—usually called <em class="emphasis">analyst</em> or <em class="emphasis">junior analyst</em>—the finance professional will advance from <em class="emphasis">senior analyst</em> to a managerial position. With each step, you’ll have greater exposure to senior management and face more important and more complex issues. Within ten to fifteen years, you may become a director or vice president. The rungs on the career ladder are pretty much the same in consulting and investment banking.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section" id="collins-ch13_s07_s03">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Positions in the Investment Industry</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch13_s07_s03_p01">In the investment industry, finance professionals can be stockbrokers, investment analysts, or portfolio managers. Each of these positions requires an ability to assimilate great quantities of information, not only about specific companies and their securities, but also about entire industries and, indeed, the economy itself.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch13_s07_s03_p02">Some investment professionals work directly with individual clients. Others provide support to those who make sell or buy recommendations. Still others manage portfolios in the mutual fund industry. A mutual fund gathers money—ranging upward from a few hundred dollars—from thousands or even millions of investors and invests it in large portfolios of stocks and other investment securities. Finance professionals review and recommend prospective investments to company managers.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch13_s07_s03_p03">Because real estate (both commercial and personal) and insurance are investment fields, many financial professionals can be found working in these areas, as well.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section" id="collins-ch13_s07_s04">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Graduate Education and Certification</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch13_s07_s04_p01">After completing the undergraduate degree with a major or concentration in finance, accounting, or economics, a finance professional may start to think about graduate school. The typical path is an MBA with a finance track. Though some schools offer a master’s in finance degree, such a program is highly specialized, with rigorous math requirements that may not appeal to everyone with an interest in finance.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch13_s07_s04_p02">Certification is a means of achieving professional distinction in a finance career. The most popular certifications include the following:</p>
        <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="collins-ch13_s07_s04_l01">
            <li>CFA or <em class="emphasis">Chartered Financial Analyst</em> (usually an investment-analyst designation)</li>
            <li>CFM or <em class="emphasis">Certified Financial Manager</em> (usually a corporate-finance designation)</li>
            <li>CCM or <em class="emphasis">Certified Cash Manager</em> (usually a corporate-treasury designation)</li>
            <li>CFP or <em class="emphasis">Certified Financial Planner</em> (usually an individual stockbroker designation)</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch13_s07_s04_p03">The insurance and real estate industries have their own certifications. In addition, because the federal government requires anyone who sells securities to be licensed, there is an entire set of licensing procedures that must be followed.</p>

        <p class="para" id="collins-ch13_s08_p01"><strong class="emphasis bold">How Much Should You Reveal in <em class="emphasis">Playboy</em>?</strong></p>
        <p class="para" id="collins-ch13_s08_p02">What can you do if you’re sitting around your dorm room with nothing else to do (or at least nothing else you want to do)? How about starting a business? It worked for Michael Dell, who found assembling and selling computers more rewarding than attending classes at the University of Texas. It also worked for two Stanford graduate students, Sergey Brin and Larry Page. They came up with a novel (though fairly simple) idea for a search engine that ranked Web sites according to number of hits and online linkages. Because their goal was to organize massive amounts of electronic data, they wanted a name that connoted seemingly infinite volumes of information. They liked the word “googol” (a child’s coinage for a very big number—1 followed by a hundred zeros), but, unfortunately, someone already owned the domain name “Googol.” So Brin and Page did a little letter juggling and settled (as we all know by now) for “Google.”</p>
        <p class="para" id="collins-ch13_s08_p03">By 2004, the company that they’d started in 1998 was the number-one search engine in the world. Their next step, like that of so many successful entrepreneurs before them, was to go public, and that’s where our exercise starts. To learn more about this episode in the epic story of Google—and to find out what role <em class="emphasis">Playboy</em> magazine plays in it—read the article, “Google Sets $2.7 Billion IPO” (<a class="link" href="http://money.cnn.com/2004/04/29/technology/google">http://money.cnn.com/2004/04/29/technology/google</a>), read Google’s <em class="emphasis">Playboy</em> interview (<a class="link" href="http://www.google-watch.org/playboy.html">http://www.google-watch.org/playboy.html</a>), and read the BusinessWeek article, “Google Dodges a Bullet” (<a class="link" href="http://www.businessweek.com/technology/content/jan2005/tc20050114_0781_tc119.htm">http://www.businessweek.com/technology/content/jan2005/tc20050114_0781_tc119.htm</a>).</p>
        <p class="para" id="collins-ch13_s08_p04">When you’ve finished reading the articles, answer the following questions:</p>
        <ol class="orderedlist" id="collins-ch13_s08_l01">
            <li>What’s an IPO? Why did Brin and Page take their company public? What disadvantages did they incur by going public? Are they likely to lose control of their company?</li>
            <li>How does a <em class="emphasis">Playboy</em> interview enter into the Google story? What did Brin and Page do wrong? (By the way, the interview appeared in the August 2004 issue of <em class="emphasis">Playboy</em>; because Google incorporated the text into its revised IPO filing, it’s now in the public domain and available online.)</li>
            <li>
                <p class="para">Did the Google founders get off the hook? Was the punishment (or lack of it) appropriate? Quitting school to run Google paid off big for Brin and Page. Their combined net worth as a result of the IPO suddenly skyrocketed to $8 billion. But how about you? Could you have gotten rich if you’d jumped on the Google bandwagon just as it started to roll? Could you at least have earned enough to pay another year’s tuition? To respond to these questions, you need to know two things: (1) the IPO price of Google stock—$85—and (2) Google’s current stock price. To find the current price, go to <a class="link" href="http://finance.yahoo.com">http://finance.yahoo.com</a> to link to the finance section of the Yahoo.com Web site. Enter Google’s stock symbol—GOOG—and click “Go.” When you find the current stock price, answer the following questions:</p>
                <ol class="orderedlist" id="collins-ch13_s08_l02" numeration="loweralpha">
                    <li>If you’d bought Google stock on the IPO date and sold it today, how many shares of Google would you have had to buy in order to make enough to cover this year’s tuition?</li>
                    <li>If you owned Google stock today, would you sell it or hold it? Explain your answer.</li>

        <p class="para" id="collins-ch13_s08_p06">One advantage of a finance major is that it prepares you for a wide range of careers. Some graduates head for Wall Street to make big bucks in investment banking. Others prefer the security of working in the corporate finance department of a large firm, while still others combine finance and selling in fields such as insurance or real estate. If you like working with other people’s finances, you might end up in commercial banking or financial planning. To better acquaint yourself with the range of available finance careers, go to <a class="link" href="http://www.careers-in-finance.com/">http://www.careers-in-finance.com/</a> to link to the Careers in Finance Web site. After reviewing the descriptions of each career option, select two areas that you find particularly interesting and two that you find unattractive. For each of your four selections, answer the following questions:</p>
        <ol class="orderedlist" id="collins-ch13_s08_l03">
            <li>Why do you find a given area interesting (or unattractive)?</li>

        <h3 class="title">Ethics Angle (AACSB)</h3>
        <p class="para" id="collins-ch13_s08_p07"><strong class="emphasis bold">The Inside Story</strong></p>
        <p class="para" id="collins-ch13_s08_p08">You’re the founder and CEO of a publicly traded biotech firm that recently came up with a promising cancer drug. Right now, life on Wall Street is good: investors are high on your company, and your stock price is rising. On top of everything else, your personal wealth is burgeoning because you own a lot of stock in the company. You’re simply waiting to hear from the FDA, which is expected to approve the product. But when the call comes, the news is bad: the FDA has decided to delay approval because of insufficient data on the drug’s effectiveness. You know that when investors hear the news, the company’s stock price will plummet. The family and friends that you encouraged to buy into your company will lose money, and you’ll take a major hit.</p>
        <p class="para" id="collins-ch13_s08_p09">Quickly, you place an order to sell about $5 million worth of your own stock. Then you start making phone calls. You tell your daughter to dump her stock, and you advise your friends to do the same thing. When you tell your stockbroker the news, he gets on the phone and gives a heads-up to his other clients. Unfortunately, he can’t reach one client (who happens to be a good friend of yours), so he instructs his assistant to contact her and tell her what’s happened. As a result, the client places an order to sell four thousand shares of stock at a market value of $225,000.</p>
        <p class="para" id="collins-ch13_s08_p10">Let’s pause at this point to answer a few questions:</p>
        <ol class="orderedlist" id="collins-ch13_s08_l04">
            <li>Are you being a nice guy or doing something illegal?</li>
            <li>Is your stockbroker doing something illegal?</li>
            <li>Is the assistant doing something illegal or merely following orders?</li>
            <li>Is the stockbroker’s client acting illegally?</li>
        </ol>
        <p class="para" id="collins-ch13_s08_p11">Fast-forward a few months. Federal investigators are interested in the sale of your stock and the sale of your daughter’s stock. Because all signs point to the truth as being an invitation to trouble, you lie. When they talked with your friend about her sale, say investigators, she explained a standing agreement that instructed her broker to sell the stock when the market price went below a specified level. It sounds like a good explanation, so you go along with it.</p>
        <p class="para" id="collins-ch13_s08_p12">Now, answer this question.</p>
        <ol class="orderedlist" id="collins-ch13_s08_l05" start="5">
            <li>What have you done wrong? What has your client friend done wrong?</li>
        </ol>
        <p class="para" id="collins-ch13_s08_p13"><strong class="emphasis bold">The Reality Version of the Story</strong></p>
        <p class="para" id="collins-ch13_s08_p14">At this point, let’s stop protecting the not-so-innocent and name some names. The biotech company is ImClone, and its founder and CEO is Dr. Samuel Waksal. The Merrill Lynch broker is named Peter Bacanovic and his assistant Douglas Faneuil. The client friend who dumped her stock is Martha Stewart.</p>
        <p class="para" id="collins-ch13_s08_p15">Let’s focus on Stewart, who is the founder of Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia, a prosperous lifestyle empire. Her actions and their consequences are detailed in an article entitled “Martha’s Fall,” which you can access by going to <a class="link" href="http://www.newsweek.com/id/53363">http://www.newsweek.com/id/53363</a> and linking to the MSNBC Web site. Read the article and then answer the following questions:</p>
        <ol class="orderedlist" id="collins-ch13_s08_l06" start="6">
            <li>Do you believe Stewart’s story that she sold the stock because of a preexisting sell order and not because she learned that the cancer drug wouldn’t be approved? What did she do that was illegal? What was she actually <em class="emphasis">convicted</em> of doing?</li>
            <li>Waksal got seven years in prison for insider trading (and a few other illegal schemes). Bacanovic (Stewart’s broker) got five months in jail and five months of home confinement for lying and obstructing the investigation into the sale of ImClone stock. In return for helping the prosecutors convict Stewart, Faneuil (the broker’s assistant) got a federal “get-out-of-jail” card but was fined $2,000 for accepting a payoff (namely, an extra week of vacation and a bump in his commission) to stonewall investigators. Stewart went to prison for five months and spent another five under house arrest. Was her punishment too lenient? Too harsh? If you’d been the judge, what sentence would you have given her?</li>
            <li>How could Stewart have avoided prison? Did her celebrity status or reputation help or hurt her? Did she, as some people claim, become a poster CEO for corporate wrongdoing?</li>
            <li>Why are government agencies, such as the SEC, concerned about insider trading? Who’s hurt by it? Who’s helped by government enforcement of insider-trading laws?</li>

        <p class="para" id="collins-ch13_s08_p27">Warren Buffett is the second-richest man in the world (behind Bill Gates) and a top investor in China’s stock market. As CEO of Berkshire Hathaway, a holding company with large stakes in a broad portfolio of investments, Buffett spends a lot of his time looking for companies with promising futures. His time has been quite well spent: the market price of a share in Berkshire Hathaway now tops $90,000—up from $16 a share in 1964.</p>
        <p class="para" id="collins-ch13_s08_p28">Among other things, Berkshire Hathaway owns two million shares in PetroChina, an energy firm 90 percent owned by the Chinese government. Surprised? To evaluate Buffett’s thinking in making such an investment, you’ll need to do a little research. First, find out something about the company by going to <a class="link" href="http://www.petrochina.com.cn/ptr">http://www.petrochina.com.cn/ptr</a> to link to the English version of the PetroChina Web site. Explore the sections “About PetroChina” and “Investor Relations.” Look for answers to the following questions:</p>
        <ol class="orderedlist" id="collins-ch13_s08_l11">
            <li>What does the company do? What products and services does it provide? How does it distribute its products?</li>

Enter the company’s stock symbol—PTR—and review the information provided on the site. To see what analysts think of the stock, for example, click on “Analyst Opinion.” (While you’re there, find out whether Berkshire Hathaway still owns stock in PetroChina—Berkshire Hathaway’s own stock isn’t up from $16 to $90,000 because Buffett tends to sit on his laurels.)</p>
