        <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch03_s00_p01">Do you wear Nike shoes or Timberland boots? Buy groceries at Tops Friendly Markets, Giant Stores, or Stop &amp; Shop? Listen to Jennifer Lopez, Bruce Springsteen, or the Dixie Chicks? If you answered yes to any of these questions, you’re a global business customer. Both Nike and Timberland manufacture most of their products overseas. The Dutch firm Royal Ahold owns all three supermarket chains. Sony Music, the label that records J. Lo, the Boss, and the Chicks, belongs to a Japanese company.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch03_s00_p02">Take an imaginary walk down Orchard Road, the most fashionable shopping area in Singapore. You’ll pass department stores such as Tokyo-based Takashimaya and London’s very British Marks &amp; Spencer, both filled with such well-known international labels as Ralph Lauren Polo, Burberry, Chanel, and Nokia. If you need a break, you can also stop for a latte at Seattle-based Starbucks or buy books, CDs, and DVDs at Borders Books and Music, which is headquartered in Ann Arbor, Michigan.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch03_s00_p03">When you’re in the Chinese capital of Beijing, don’t miss Tiananmen Square. Parked in front of the Great Hall of the People, the seat of Chinese government, are fleets of black Buicks, cars made by General Motors in Flint, Michigan. If you’re adventurous enough to find yourself in Faisalabad, a medium-size city in Pakistan, you’ll see locals riding donkeys, camels pulling carts piled with agricultural produce, and Hamdard University, located in a refurbished hotel. Step inside its computer labs, and the sensation of being in a faraway place will likely disappear: on the computer screens, you’ll recognize the familiar Microsoft flag—the same one emblazoned on screens in Microsoft’s hometown of Seattle and just about everywhere else on the planet.</p>

    <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch03_s01_p01">The globalization of business is bound to affect you. Not only will you buy products manufactured overseas, but it’s highly likely that you’ll meet and work with individuals from various countries and cultures as customers, suppliers, colleagues, employees, or employers. The bottom line is that the globalization of world commerce has an impact on all of us. Therefore, it makes sense to learn more about how globalization works.</p>

    <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch03_s01_p02">Never before has business spanned the globe the way it does today. But why is international business important? Why do companies and nations engage in international trade? What strategies do they employ in the global marketplace? What challenges do companies face when they do business overseas? How do governments and international agencies promote and regulate international trade? Is the globalization of business a good thing? What career opportunities are there for you in global business? How should you prepare yourself to take advantage of them? These are the questions that we’ll be addressing in this chapter. Let’s start by looking at the more specific reasons why companies and nations engage in international trade.</p>
    <div class="section" id="collins-ch03_s01_s01">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Why Do Nations Trade?</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch03_s01_s01_p01">Why does the United States import automobiles, steel, digital phones, and apparel from other countries? Why don’t we just make them ourselves? Why do other countries buy wheat, chemicals, machinery, and consulting services from us? Because no national economy produces all the goods and services that its people need. Countries are <em class="emphasis">importers</em> when they buy goods and services from other countries; when they sell products to other nations, they’re <em class="emphasis">exporters</em>. (We’ll discuss importing and exporting in greater detail later in the chapter.) The monetary value of international trade is enormous. In 2007, the total value of worldwide trade in merchandise and commercial services was $16.8 <em class="emphasis">trillion</em>.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-collins-fn03_001">World Trade Organization, press release, “WTO: developing, transition economies cushion trade slowdown,” April 17, 2008 (accessed November 1, 2008).</span></p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Absolute and Comparative Advantage</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch03_s01_s02_p01">To understand why certain countries import or export certain products, you need to realize that every country (or region) can’t produce the same products. The cost of labor, the availability of natural resources, and the level of know-how vary greatly around the world. Most economists use the concepts of <em class="emphasis">absolute advantage</em> and <em class="emphasis">comparative advantage</em> to explain why countries import some products and export others.</p>
        <div class="section" id="collins-ch03_s01_s02_s01">
            <h2 class="title editable block">Absolute Advantage</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch03_s01_s02_s01_p01">A nation has an <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">absolute advantage</a><span class="glossdef">Condition whereby a country is the only source of a product or is able to make more of a product using the same or fewer resources than other countries.</span></span> if (1) it’s the only source of a particular product or (2) it can make more of a product using the same amount of or fewer resources than other countries. Because of climate and soil conditions, for example, Brazil has an absolute advantage in coffee beans and France has an absolute advantage in wine production. Unless, however, an absolute advantage is based on some limited natural resource, it seldom lasts. That’s why there are few examples of absolute advantage in the world today. Even France’s dominance of worldwide wine production, for example, is being challenged by growing wine industries in Italy, Spain, and the United States.</p>

        <div class="section" id="collins-ch03_s01_s02_s02">
            <h2 class="title editable block">Comparative Advantage</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch03_s01_s02_s02_p01">How can we predict, for any given country, which products will be made and sold at home, which will be imported, and which will be exported? This question can be answered by looking at the concept of <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">comparative advantage</a><span class="glossdef">Condition whereby one nation is able to produce a product at a lower opportunity cost compared to another nation.</span></span>, which exists when a country can produce a product at a lower opportunity cost compared to another nation. But what’s an <em class="emphasis">opportunity cost</em>? Opportunity costs are the products that a country must decline to make in order to produce something else. When a country decides to specialize in a particular product, it must sacrifice the production of another product.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch03_s01_s02_s02_p02">Let’s simplify things by imagining a world with only two countries—the Republic of High Tech and the Kingdom of Low Tech. Each country knows how to make two and only two products: wooden boats and telescopes. Each country spends half its resources (labor and capital) on each good. <a class="xref" href="#collins-ch03_s01_s02_s02_f01">Figure 3.3 "Comparative Advantage in the Techs"</a> shows the daily output for both countries. (They’re not highly productive, as we’ve imagined two <em class="emphasis">very</em> small countries.)</p>
            <div class="figure large editable block" id="collins-ch03_s01_s02_s02_f01">
                <p class="title"><span class="title-prefix">Figure 3.3</span> Comparative Advantage in the Techs</p>

            </div>
            <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch03_s01_s02_s02_p03">First, note that High Tech has an <em class="emphasis">absolute</em> advantage in both boats and telescopes: it can make more boats (three versus two) and more telescopes (nine versus one) than Low Tech can with the same resources. So, why doesn’t High Tech make <em class="emphasis">all</em> the boats and <em class="emphasis">all</em> the telescopes needed for <em class="emphasis">both</em> countries? Because it lacks sufficient resources and must, therefore, decide how much of its resources to devote to each of the two goods. Assume, for example, that each country could devote 100 percent of its resources on <em class="emphasis">either</em> of the two goods. Start with boats. If both countries spend <em class="emphasis">all</em> their resources on boats (and make no telescopes), here’s what happens:</p>
            <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="collins-ch03_s01_s02_s02_l01">
                <li>High Tech makes, for example, three more boats but gives up the opportunity to make the nine telescopes; thus the opportunity cost of making <em class="emphasis">each</em> boat is three telescopes (9 ÷ 3 = 3).</li>
                <li>Low Tech makes, for example, two more boats but gives up the opportunity to make one telescope; thus the opportunity cost of making <em class="emphasis">each</em> boat is half a telescope (1 ÷ 2 = 1/2).</li>
                <li>Low Tech, therefore, enjoys a <em class="emphasis">lower opportunity cost</em>: Because it must give up less to make the extra boats, it has a comparative advantage for boats. And because it’s better—that is, more efficient—at making boats than at making telescopes, it should specialize in boat making.</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch03_s01_s02_s02_p04">Now to telescopes. Here’s what happens if each country spends all its time making telescopes and makes no boats:</p>
            <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="collins-ch03_s01_s02_s02_l02">
                <li>High Tech makes, for example, nine more telescopes but gives up the opportunity to make three boats; thus, the opportunity cost of making <em class="emphasis">each</em> telescope is one third of a boat (3 ÷ 9 = 1/3).</li>
                <li>Low Tech makes, for example, one more telescope but gives up the opportunity to make two boats; thus, the opportunity cost of making <em class="emphasis">each</em> telescope is two boats (2 ÷ 1 = 2).</li>
                <li>In this case, High Tech has the <em class="emphasis">lower opportunity cost</em>: Because it had to give up less to make the extra telescopes, it enjoys a comparative advantage for telescopes. And because it’s better—more efficient—at making telescopes than at making boats, it should specialize in telescope making.</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch03_s01_s02_s02_p05">Each country will specialize in making the good for which it has a comparative advantage—that is, the good that it can make most efficiently, relative to the other country. High Tech will devote its resources to telescopes (which it’s good at making), and Low Tech will put its resources into boat making (which it does well). High Tech will export its excess telescopes to Low Tech, which will pay for the telescopes with the money it earns by selling its excess boats to High Tech. Both countries will be better off.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch03_s01_s02_s02_p06">Things are a lot more complex in the real world, but, generally speaking, nations trade to exploit their advantages. They benefit from specialization, focusing on what they do best, and trading the output to other countries for what <em class="emphasis">they</em> do best. The United States, for instance, is increasingly an exporter of knowledge-based products, such as software, movies, music, and professional services (management consulting, financial services, and so forth). America’s colleges and universities, therefore, are a source of comparative advantage, and students from all over the world come to the United States for the world’s best higher-education system.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch03_s01_s02_s02_p07">France and Italy are centers for fashion and luxury goods and are leading exporters of wine, perfume, and designer clothing. Japan’s engineering expertise has given it an edge in such fields as automobiles and consumer electronics. And with large numbers of highly skilled graduates in technology, India has become the world’s leader in low-cost, computer-software engineering.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">How Do We Measure Trade between Nations?</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch03_s01_s03_p01">To evaluate the nature and consequences of its international trade, a nation looks at two key indicators. We determine a country’s <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">balance of trade</a><span class="glossdef">Difference between the value of a nation’s imports and its exports during a specified period.</span></span> by subtracting the value of its imports from the value of its exports. If a country sells more products than it buys, it has a favorable balance, called a <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">trade surplus</a><span class="glossdef">Condition whereby a country sells more products than it buys, resulting in a favorable trade balance.</span></span>. If it buys more than it sells, it has an unfavorable balance, or a <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">trade deficit</a><span class="glossdef">Condition whereby a country buys more products than it sells, resulting in an unfavorable trade balance.</span></span>.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch03_s01_s03_p02">For many years, the United States has had a trade deficit: we buy far more goods from the rest of the world than we sell overseas. This fact shouldn’t be surprising. With high income levels, we not only consume a sizable portion of our own domestically produced goods but enthusiastically buy imported goods. Other countries, such as China and Taiwan, which manufacture primarily for export, have large trade surpluses because they sell far more goods overseas than they buy.</p>
        <div class="section" id="collins-ch03_s01_s03_s01">
            <h2 class="title editable block">Managing the National Credit Card</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch03_s01_s03_s01_p01">Are trade deficits a bad thing? Not necessarily. They can be positive if a country’s economy is strong enough both to keep growing and to generate the jobs and incomes that permit its citizens to buy the best the world has to offer. That was certainly the case in the United States in the 1990s. Some experts, however, are alarmed at our rapidly accelerating trade deficit. Investment guru Warren Buffet, for example, cautions that no country can continuously sustain large and burgeoning trade deficits. Why not? Because creditor nations will eventually stop taking IOUs from debtor nations, and when that happens, the national spending spree will have to cease. “Our national credit card,” he warns, “allows us to charge truly breathtaking amounts. But that card’s credit line is not limitless.”<span class="footnote" id="fwk-collins-fn03_002">Warren E. Buffet, “Why I’m Not Buying the U.S. Dollar,” <em class="emphasis">Wall Street Week with Fortune</em>, <a class="link" href="http://www.pbs.org/wsw/news/fortunearticle_20031026_03.html">http://www.pbs.org/wsw/news/fortunearticle_20031026_03.html</a> (accessed May 25, 2006).</span></p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch03_s01_s03_s01_p02">By the same token, trade surpluses aren’t necessarily good for a nation’s consumers. Japan’s export-fueled economy produced high economic growth in the 1970s and 1980s. But most domestically made consumer goods were priced at artificially high levels inside Japan itself—so high, in fact, that many Japanese traveled overseas to buy the electronics and other high-quality goods on which Japanese trade was dependent. CD players and televisions were significantly cheaper in Honolulu or Los Angeles than in Tokyo. How did this situation come about? Though Japan manufactures a variety of goods, many of them are made for export. To secure shares in international markets, Japan prices its exported goods competitively. Inside Japan, because competition is limited, producers can put artificially high prices on Japanese-made goods. Due to a number of factors (high demand for a limited supply of imported goods, high shipping and distribution costs, and other costs incurred by importers in a nation that tends to protect its own industries), imported goods are also expensive.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-collins-fn03_003">“Why Are Prices in Japan So Damn High?” <em class="emphasis">The Japan FAQ</em>, <a class="link" href="http://www.geocities.com/japanfaq/FAQ-Prices.html">http://www.geocities.com/japanfaq/FAQ-Prices.html</a> (accessed May 25, 2006).</span></p>

            <h2 class="title editable block">Balance of Payments</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch03_s01_s03_s02_p01">The second key measure of the effectiveness of international trade is <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">balance of payments</a><span class="glossdef">Difference between the total flow of money coming into a country and the total flow of money going out.</span></span>: the difference, over a period of time, between the total flow of money coming into a country and the total flow of money going out. As in its balance of trade, the biggest factor in a country’s balance of payments is the money that comes in and goes out as a result of imports and exports. But balance of payments includes other cash inflows and outflows, such as cash received from or paid for foreign investment, loans, tourism, military expenditures, and foreign aid. For example, if a U.S. company buys some real estate in a foreign country, that investment counts in the U.S. balance of payments, but not in its balance of trade, which measures only import and export transactions. In the long run, having an unfavorable balance of payments can negatively affect the stability of a country’s currency. Some observers are worried about the U.S. dollar, which has undergone an accelerating pattern of unfavorable balances of payments since the 1970s. For one thing, carrying negative balances has forced the United States to cover its debt by borrowing from other countries.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-collins-fn03_004">Warren E.

    </div>
    <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch03_s02_p01">The fact that nations exchange billions of dollars in goods and services each year demonstrates that international trade makes good economic sense. For an American company wishing to expand beyond national borders, there are a variety of ways it can get involved in international business. Let’s take a closer look at the more popular ones.</p>
    <div class="section" id="collins-ch03_s02_s01">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Importing and Exporting</h2>

        <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch03_s02_s01_p01"><span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Importing</a><span class="glossdef">Practice of buying products overseas and reselling them in one’s own country.</span></span> (buying products overseas and reselling them in one’s own country) and <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">exporting</a><span class="glossdef">Practice of selling domestic products to foreign customers.</span></span> (selling domestic products to foreign customers) are the oldest and most prevalent forms of international trade. For many companies, importing is the primary link to the global market. American food and beverage wholesalers, for instance, import the bottled water Evian from its source in the French Alps for resale in U.S. supermarkets.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-collins-fn03_005">Fine Waters Media, “Bottled Water of France,” <a class="link" href="http://www.finewaters.com/Bottled_Water/France/Evian.asp">http://www.finewaters.com/Bottled_Water/France/Evian.asp</a> (accessed May 25, 2006).</span> Other companies get into the global arena by identifying an international market for their products and become exporters. The Chinese, for instance, are increasingly fond of fast foods cooked in soybean oil. Because they also have an increasing appetite for meat, they need high-protein soybeans to raise livestock.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-collins-fn03_006">H. Frederick Gale, “China’s Growing Affluence: How Food Markets Are Responding” (U.S. Department of Agriculture, June 2003), <a class="link" href="http://www.ers.usda.gov/Amberwaves/June03/Features/ChinasGrowingAffluence.htm">http://www.ers.usda.gov/Amberwaves/June03/Features/ChinasGrowingAffluence.htm</a> (accessed May 25, 2006).</span> As a result, American farmers now export over $1 billion worth of soybeans to China every year.</p>

    <div class="section" id="collins-ch03_s02_s02">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Licensing and Franchising</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch03_s02_s02_p01">A company that wants to get into an international market quickly while taking only limited financial and legal risks might consider licensing agreements with foreign companies. An <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">international licensing agreement</a><span class="glossdef">Agreement that allows a foreign company to sell a domestic company’s products or use its intellectual property in exchange for royalty fees.</span></span> allows a foreign company (the <em class="emphasis">licensee</em>) to sell the products of a producer (the <em class="emphasis">licensor</em>) or to use its intellectual property (such as patents, trademarks, copyrights) in exchange for royalty fees. Here’s how it works: You own a company in the United States that sells coffee-flavored popcorn. You’re sure that your product would be a big hit in Japan, but you don’t have the resources to set up a factory or sales office in that country. You can’t make the popcorn here and ship it to Japan because it would get stale. So you enter into a licensing agreement with a Japanese company that allows your licensee to manufacture coffee-flavored popcorn using your special process and to sell it in Japan under your brand name. In exchange, the Japanese licensee would pay you a royalty fee.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch03_s02_s02_p02">Another popular way to expand overseas is to sell franchises. Under an <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">international franchise</a><span class="glossdef">Agreement in which a domestic company (franchiser) gives a foreign company (franchisee) the right to use its brand and sell its products.</span></span> agreement, a company (the <em class="emphasis">franchiser</em>) grants a foreign company (the <em class="emphasis">franchisee</em>) the right to use its brand name and to sell its products or services. The franchisee is responsible for all operations but agrees to operate according to a business model established by the franchiser. In turn, the franchiser usually provides advertising, training, and new-product assistance. Franchising is a natural form of global expansion for companies that operate domestically according to a franchise model, including restaurant chains, such as McDonald’s and Kentucky Fried Chicken, and hotel chains, such as Holiday Inn and Best Western.</p>

    <div class="section" id="collins-ch03_s02_s03">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Contract Manufacturing and Outsourcing</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch03_s02_s03_p01">Because of high domestic labor costs, many U.S. companies manufacture their products in countries where labor costs are lower. This arrangement is called <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">international contract manufacturing</a><span class="glossdef">Practice by which a company produces goods through an independent contractor in a foreign country.</span></span> or <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">outsourcing</a><span class="glossdef">Practice of using outside vendors to manufacture all or part of a company’s actual products.</span></span>. A U.S. company might contract with a local company in a foreign country to manufacture one of its products. It will, however, retain control of product design and development and put its own label on the finished product. Contract manufacturing is quite common in the U.S. apparel business, with most American brands being made in Asia (China and Malaysia) and Latin America (Mexico and the Dominican Republic).</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch03_s02_s03_p02">Thanks to twenty-first-century information technology, nonmanufacturing functions can also be outsourced to nations with lower labor costs. U.S. companies increasingly draw on a vast supply of relatively inexpensive skilled labor to perform various business services, such as software development, accounting, and claims processing. For years, American insurance companies have processed much of their claims-related paperwork in Ireland. With a large, well-educated population, India has become a center for software development and customer-call centers for American companies. In the case of India, as you can see in <a class="xref" href="#collins-ch03_s02_s03_t01">Table 3.1 "Selected Hourly Wages, United States and India"</a>, the attraction is not only a large pool of knowledge workers, but also significantly lower wages.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Foreign Direct Investment and Subsidiaries</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch03_s02_s05_p01">Many of the approaches to global expansion that we’ve discussed so far allow companies to participate in international markets without investing in foreign plants and facilities. As markets expand, however, a firm might decide to enhance its competitive advantage by making a direct investment in operations conducted in another country. <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Foreign direct investment (FDI)</a><span class="glossdef">Formal establishment of business operations (such as the building of factories or sales offices) on foreign soil.</span></span> refers to the formal establishment of business operations on foreign soil—the building of factories, sales offices, and distribution networks to serve local markets in a nation other than the company’s home country.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch03_s02_s05_p02">FDI is generally the most expensive commitment that a firm can make to an overseas market, and it’s typically driven by the size and attractiveness of the target market. For example, German and Japanese automakers, such as BMW, Mercedes, Toyota, and Honda, have made serious commitments to the U.S. market: most of the cars and trucks that they build in plants in the South and Midwest are destined for sale in the United States.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch03_s02_s05_p03">A common form of FDI is the <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">foreign subsidiary</a><span class="glossdef">Independent company owned by a foreign firm (called its parent).</span></span>: an independent company owned by a foreign firm (called the <em class="emphasis">parent</em>). This approach to going international not only gives the parent company full access to local markets but also exempts it from any laws or regulations that may hamper the activities of foreign firms. The parent company has tight control over the operations of a subsidiary, but while senior managers from the parent company often oversee operations, many managers and employees are citizens of the host country. Not surprisingly, most very large firms have foreign subsidiaries. IBM and Coca-Cola, for example, have both had success in the Japanese market through their foreign subsidiaries (IBM-Japan and Coca-Cola–Japan). FDI goes in the other direction, too, and many companies operating in the United States are in fact subsidiaries of foreign firms. Gerber Products, for example, is a subsidiary of the Swiss company Novartis, while Stop &amp; Shop and Giant Food Stores belong to the Dutch company Royal Ahold.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch03_s02_s05_p05">All these strategies have been successful in the arena of global business. But success in international business involves more than merely finding the best way to reach international markets. Doing global business is a complex, risky endeavor. As many companies have learned the hard way, people and organizations don’t do things the same way abroad as they do at home. What differences make global business so tricky? That’s the question that we’ll turn to next.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch03_s02_s06_p02">MNCs often adopt the approach encapsulated in the motto “Think globally, act locally.” They often adjust their operations, products, marketing, and distribution to mesh with the environments of the countries in which they operate. Because they understand that a “one-size-fits-all” mentality doesn’t make good business sense when they’re trying to sell products in different markets, they’re willing to accommodate cultural and economic differences. Increasingly, MNCs supplement their mainstream product line with products designed for local markets. Coca-Cola, for example, produces coffee and citrus-juice drinks developed specifically for the Japanese market.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-collins-fn03_010">James C. Morgan and J. Jeffrey Morgan, <em class="emphasis">Cracking the Japanese Market</em> (New York: Free Press, 1991), 102.</span> When such companies as Nokia and Motorola design cell phones, they’re often geared to local tastes in color, size, and other features. McDonald’s provides a vegetarian menu in India, where religious convictions affect the demand for beef and pork.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-collins-fn03_011">McDonald’s India, “Respect for Local Culture,” <a class="link" href="http://www.mcdonaldsindia.com/loccul.htm">http://www.mcdonaldsindia.com/loccul.htm</a> (accessed May 25, 2006).</span> In Germany, McDonald’s caters to local tastes by offering beer in some restaurants.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-collins-fn03_012">McDonald’s Corp., “A Taste of McDonald’s Around the World,” <em class="emphasis">media.mcdonalds.com</em>, <a class="link" href="http://www.media.mcdonalds.com/secured/products/international">http://www.media.mcdonalds.com/secured/products/international</a> (accessed May 25, 2006).</span></p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch03_s02_s06_p03">Likewise, many MNCs have made themselves more sensitive to local market conditions by decentralizing their decision making. While corporate headquarters still maintain a fair amount of control, home-country managers keep a suitable distance by relying on modern telecommunications. Today, fewer managers are dispatched from headquarters; MNCs depend instead on local talent. Not only does decentralized organization speed up and improve decision making, but it also allows an MNC to project the image of a local company. IBM, for instance, has been quite successful in the Japanese market because local customers and suppliers perceive it as a Japanese company. Crucial to this perception is the fact that the vast majority of IBM’s Tokyo employees, including top leadership, are Japanese nationals.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-collins-fn03_013">James C.

            <h2 class="title editable block">Criticism of MNC Culture</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch03_s02_s06_s01_p01">The global reach of MNCs is a source of criticism, as well as praise. Critics argue that they often destroy the livelihoods of home-country workers by moving jobs to developing countries where workers are willing to labor under poor conditions and for less pay. They also contend that traditional lifestyles and values are being weakened, and even destroyed, as global brands foster a global culture of American movies; fast food; and cheap, mass-produced consumer products. Still others claim that the demand of MNCs for constant economic growth and cheaper access to natural resources do irreversible damage to the physical environment. All these negative consequences, critics maintain, stem from the abuses of international trade—from the policy of placing profits above people, on a global scale. These views surfaced in violent street demonstrations in Seattle in 1999 and Genoa, Italy, in 2000, and since then, meetings of the International Monetary Fund and World Bank have regularly been assailed by large crowds of protestors who have succeeded in catching the attention of the worldwide media.</p>

They also argue that globalization increases cross-cultural understanding. Says Anne O. Kruger, first deputy managing director of the IMF:</p>

We have observed the increased well being of a larger percentage of the world’s population by a greater increment than ever before in history. Growing incomes give people the ability to spend on things other than basic food and shelter, in particular on things such as education and health. This ability, combined with the sharing among nations of medical and scientific advances, has transformed life in many parts of the developing world. Infant mortality has declined from 180 per 1,000 births in 1950 to 60 per 1,000 births. Literacy rates have risen from an average of 40 percent in the 1950s to over 70 percent today.

The differences between the foreign landscape and the one with which they’re familiar are often huge and multifaceted. Some are quite obvious, such as differences in language, currency, and everyday habits (say, using chopsticks instead of silverware). But others are subtle, complex, and sometimes even hidden. Success in international business means understanding a wide range of cultural, economic, legal, and political differences between countries. Let’s look at some of the more important of these differences.</p>
    <div class="section" id="collins-ch03_s03_s01">
        <h2 class="title editable block">The Cultural Environment</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch03_s03_s01_p01">Even when two people from the same country communicate, there’s always a possibility of misunderstanding. When people from different countries get together, that possibility increases substantially.

Cultural differences create challenges to successful international business dealings. We explain a few of these challenges in the following sections.</p>
        <div class="section" id="collins-ch03_s03_s01_s01">
            <h2 class="title editable block">Language</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch03_s03_s01_s01_p01">English is the international language of business. The natives of such European countries as France and Spain certainly take pride in their own languages and cultures, but nevertheless English is the business language of the European Community. Whereas only a few educated Europeans have studied Italian or Norwegian, most have studied English. Similarly, on the South Asian subcontinent, where hundreds of local languages and dialects are spoken, English is the official language. In most corners of the world, English-only speakers—such as most Americans—have no problem finding competent translators and interpreters. So why is language an issue for English speakers doing business in the global marketplace?</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch03_s03_s01_s01_p02">In many countries, only members of the educated classes speak English. The larger population—which is usually the market you want to tap—speaks the local tongue. Advertising messages and sales appeals must take this fact into account. More than one English translation of an advertising slogan has resulted in a humorous (and perhaps serious) blunder. Some classics are listed in <a class="xref" href="#collins-ch03_s03_s01_s01_t01">Table 3.2 "Lost in Translation"</a>.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch03_s03_s01_s01_p03">Furthermore, relying on translators and interpreters puts you as an international businessperson at a disadvantage. You’re privy only to <em class="emphasis">interpretations</em> of the messages that you’re getting, and this handicap can result in a real competitive problem. Maybe you’ll misread the subtler intentions of the person with whom you’re trying to conduct business. The best way to combat this problem is to study foreign languages. Most people appreciate some effort to communicate in their local language, even on the most basic level. They even appreciate mistakes you make resulting from a desire to demonstrate your genuine interest in the language of your counterparts in foreign countries. The same principle goes doubly when you’re introducing yourself to non-English speakers in the United States. Few things work faster to encourage a friendly atmosphere than a native speaker’s willingness to greet a foreign guest in the guest’s native language.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch03_s03_s01_s02_p01">Americans take for granted many of the cultural aspects of our business practices. Most of our meetings, for instance, focus on business issues, and we tend to start and end our meetings on schedule. These habits stem from a broader cultural preference: we don’t like to waste time. (It was an American, Benjamin Franklin, who coined the phrase “Time is Money.”) This preference, however, is by no means universal. The expectation that meetings will start on time and adhere to precise agendas is common in parts of Europe (especially the Germanic countries), as well as in the United States, but elsewhere—say, in Latin America and the Middle East—people are often late to meetings.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch03_s03_s01_s03_p01">Likewise, don’t expect businesspeople from these regions—or businesspeople from most of Mediterranean Europe, for that matter—to “get down to business” as soon as a meeting has started. They’ll probably ask about your health and that of your family, inquire whether you’re enjoying your visit to their country, suggest local foods, and generally appear to be avoiding serious discussion at all costs. For Americans, such topics are conducive to nothing but idle chitchat, but in certain cultures, getting started this way is a matter of simple politeness and hospitality.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch03_s03_s01_s03_p02">If you ever find yourself in such a situation, the best advice is to go with the flow and be receptive to cultural nuances. In <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">high-context cultures</a><span class="glossdef">Cultures in which personal and family connections have an effect on most interactions, including those in business.</span></span>, the numerous interlocking (and often unstated) personal and family connections that hold people together have an effect on almost all interactions. Because people’s personal lives overlap with their business lives (and vice versa), it’s important to get to know your potential business partners as human beings and individuals.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch03_s03_s01_s03_p03">By contrast, in <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">low-context cultures</a><span class="glossdef">Cultures in which personal and work relationships are compartmentalized.</span></span>, such as those of the United States, Germany, Switzerland, and the Scandinavian countries, personal and work relationships are more compartmentalized: you don’t necessarily need to know much about the personal context of a person’s life to deal with him or her in the business arena.</p>

Southern Europeans and Middle Easterners are quite animated, favoring expressive body language along with hand gestures and raised voices. Northern Europeans are far more reserved.

In addition, the <em class="emphasis">distance</em> at which one feels comfortable when talking with someone varies by culture. People from the Middle East like to converse from a distance of a foot or less, while Americans prefer more personal space.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch03_s03_s01_s04_p02">Finally, while people in some cultures prefer to deliver direct, clear messages, others use language that’s subtler or more indirect. North Americans and most Northern Europeans fall into the former category and many Asians into the latter. But even within these categories, there are differences. Though typically polite, Chinese and Koreans are extremely direct in expression, while Japanese are indirect. This example brings up two important points. First, avoid lumping loosely related cultures together. We sometimes talk, for example, about “Asian culture,” but such broad categories as “Asian” are usually oversimplifications. Japanese culture is different from Korean, which is different from Chinese. Second, never assume that two people from the same culture will always act in a similar manner. Not all Latin Americans are casual about meeting times, not all Italians use animated body language, and not all Germans are formal.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch03_s03_s01_s04_p03">In summary, learn about a country’s culture and use your knowledge to help improve the quality of your business dealings. Learn to value the subtle differences among cultures, but don’t allow cultural stereotypes to dictate how you interact with people from <em class="emphasis">any</em> culture. Treat each person as an individual and spend time getting to know what he or she is about.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch03_s03_s02_s02_p01">If every nation used the same currency, international trade would be a lot easier. Unfortunately, this is not the case. Let’s say that your business is importing watches from Switzerland. Because the watchmaker will want to be paid in Swiss francs, you have to figure out how many U.S. dollars you’ll need to buy the francs with which to pay the watchmaker. You’d start by finding out the exchange rate between the Swiss franc and the U.S. dollar. The <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">exchange rate</a><span class="glossdef">Value of one currency relative to another.</span></span> tells you how much one currency is worth <em class="emphasis">relative to another currency</em>. So you need to know the value of the Swiss franc relative to the U.S. dollar.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch03_s03_s02_s02_p02">You could simply look in a newspaper or go to any number of Web sites—say, <a class="link" href="http://www.oanda.com">http://www.oanda.com</a>. Remember, however, that the exchange rate changes frequently. To keep things simple, let’s assume that the exchange rate is 1 Swiss franc = $0.81 U.S. (that is, 1 Swiss franc is worth $0.81). Let’s also assume that you owe the Swiss watchmaker 1,000 francs. Doing some quick math, you figure that it will take $810 to buy 1,000 francs (1,000 francs × the exchange rate of $0.81 = $810).</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch03_s03_s02_s02_p03">Now let’s say that you don’t have the cash flow to pay the watchmaker for two weeks. When you check the exchange rate two weeks later, you find that it has changed to 1 Swiss franc = $0.85. Are you better off or worse off? It’s easy to check: 1,000 francs × the new exchange rate of $0.85 = $850. You’ve just learned the hard way that when the value of the franc relative to the dollar goes up, it costs you more to buy something from Switzerland. You probably can’t help but wonder what would have happened if the value of the franc relative to the dollar had gone <em class="emphasis">down</em>—say, to $0.72 per franc. At this rate, you’d need only $720 to pay the 1,000 francs (1,000 × $0.72). In other words, when the value of the franc relative to the dollar drops, it costs less to buy goods from Switzerland. In sum you’ve learned the following:</p>
            <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="collins-ch03_s03_s02_s02_l01">
                <li>If a foreign currency goes <em class="emphasis">up</em> relative to the U.S. dollar, Americans must pay <em class="emphasis">more</em> for goods and services purchased from sellers in the country issuing the currency (foreign products are more expensive).</li>
                <li>If a foreign currency goes <em class="emphasis">down</em> relative to the U.S. dollar, Americans pay <em class="emphasis">less</em> for products from the country issuing the currency (foreign products are cheaper).</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch03_s03_s02_s02_p04">In the interest of being thorough, let’s look at this phenomenon from the perspective of an American seller and a Swiss buyer. First, we need to know the exchange rate for the U.S. dollar relative to the franc, which happens to be $1 U.S. = 1.23 francs. This means that if you want to sell something—let’s say your latest painting—for $1,000 U.S. to an art lover in Switzerland, the Swiss buyer will need 1,230 francs to get the $1,000 needed to pay you. If the exchange rate were $1 U.S. = 1.40 francs, the cost of the painting would be $1,400. So now you also know the following:</p>
            <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="collins-ch03_s03_s02_s02_l02">
                <li>If the U.S. dollar goes <em class="emphasis">up</em> relative to a foreign currency, foreign buyers must pay <em class="emphasis">more</em> for American goods and services (they become more expensive).</li>

        <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch03_s03_s03_p01">One of the more difficult aspects of doing business globally is dealing with vast differences in legal and regulatory environments. The United States, for example, has an established set of laws and regulations that provide direction to businesses operating within its borders. But because there is no global legal system, key areas of business law—for example, contract provisions and copyright protection—can be treated in different ways in different countries. Companies doing international business often face many inconsistent laws and regulations. To navigate this sea of confusion, American businesspeople must know and follow both U.S. laws and regulations and those of nations in which they operate.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch03_s03_s03_p02">The annals of business history are filled with stories about American companies that have stumbled in trying to comply with foreign laws and regulations. Coca-Cola, for example, ran afoul of Italian law when it printed its ingredients list on the bottle cap rather than on the bottle itself. Italian courts ruled that the labeling was inadequate because most people throw the cap away. In another case, 3M applied to the Japanese government to create a joint venture with the Sumitomo Industrial Group to make and distribute magnetic tape products in Japan. 3M spent four years trying to satisfy Japan’s complex regulations, but by the time it got approval, domestic competitors, including Sony, had captured the market. By delaying 3M, Japanese regulators managed, in effect, to stifle foreign competition.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-collins-fn03_016">David Ricks, <em class="emphasis">Blunders in International Business</em> (Malden, MA: Blackwell, 1999), 137.</span></p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch03_s03_s03_p03">One approach to dealing with local laws and regulations is hiring lawyers from the host country who can provide advice on legal issues.

            <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch03_s03_s03_s01_p01">One U.S. law that creates unique challenges for American firms operating overseas is the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA), which prohibits the distribution of bribes and other favors in the conduct of business. Unfortunately, though they’re illegal in this country, such tactics as kickbacks and bribes are business-as-usual in many nations. According to some experts, American businesspeople are at a competitive disadvantage if they’re prohibited from giving bribes or undercover payments to foreign officials or businesspeople who expect them; it’s like asking for good service in a restaurant when the waiter knows you won’t be giving a tip. In theory, because the FPCA warns foreigners that Americans can’t give bribes, they’ll eventually stop expecting them.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch03_s03_s03_s01_p02">Where are American businesspeople most likely and least likely to encounter bribe requests and related forms of corruption?

    </div>
    <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch03_s04_p01">The debate about the extent to which countries should control the flow of foreign goods and investments across their borders is as old as international trade itself. Governments continue to control trade. To better understand how and why, let’s examine a hypothetical case. Suppose you’re in charge of a small country in which people do two things—grow food and make clothes. Because the quality of both products is high and the prices are reasonable, your consumers are happy to buy locally made food and clothes. But one day, a farmer from a nearby country crosses your border with several wagonloads of wheat to sell. On the same day, a foreign clothes maker arrives with a large shipment of clothes. These two entrepreneurs want to sell food and clothes in your country at prices below those that local consumers now pay for domestically made food and clothes. At first, this seems like a good deal for your consumers: they won’t have to pay as much for food and clothes. But then you remember all the people in your country who grow food and make clothes. If no one buys their goods (because the imported goods are cheaper), what will happen to their livelihoods? Will everybody be out of work? And if everyone’s unemployed, what will happen to your national economy?</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch03_s04_p02">That’s when you decide to protect your farmers and clothes makers by setting up trade rules. Maybe you’ll increase the prices of imported goods by adding a tax to them; you might even make the tax so high that they’re more expensive than your homemade goods. Or perhaps you’ll help your farmers grow food more cheaply by giving them financial help to defray their costs. The government payments that you give to the farmers to help offset some of their costs of production are called <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">subsidies</a><span class="glossdef">Government payments given to certain industries to help offset some of their costs of production.</span></span>. These subsidies will allow the farmers to lower the price of their goods to a point below that of imported competitors’ goods. What’s even better is that the lower costs will allow the farmers to export their own goods at attractive, competitive prices.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch03_s04_p03">The United States has a long history of subsidizing farmers. Subsidy programs guarantee farmers (including large corporate farms) a certain price for their crops, regardless of the market price. This guarantee ensures stable income in the farming community but can have a negative impact on the world economy. How? Critics argue that in allowing American farmers to export crops at artificially low prices, U.S. agricultural subsidies permit them to compete unfairly with farmers in developing countries. A reverse situation occurs in the steel industry, in which a number of countries—China, Japan, Russia, Germany, and Brazil—subsidize domestic producers. U.S. trade unions charge that this practice gives an unfair advantage to foreign producers and hurts the American steel industry, which can’t compete on price with subsidized imports.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch03_s04_p04">Whether they push up the price of imports or push down the price of local goods, such initiatives will help locally produced goods compete more favorably with foreign goods. Both strategies are forms of <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">trade controls</a><span class="glossdef">Government policies that restrict free trade.</span></span>—policies that restrict free trade. Because they protect domestic industries by reducing foreign competition, the use of such controls is often called <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">protectionism</a><span class="glossdef">Use of trade controls to reduce foreign competition in order to protect domestic industries.</span></span>. Though there’s considerable debate over the pros and cons of this practice, all countries engage in it to some extent. Before debating the issue, however, let’s learn about the more common types of trade restrictions: tariffs, quotas, and, embargoes.</p>
    <div class="section" id="collins-ch03_s04_s01">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Tariffs</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch03_s04_s01_p01"><span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Tariffs</a><span class="glossdef">Government taxes on imports that raise the price of foreign goods and make them less competitive with domestic goods.</span></span> are taxes on imports. Because they raise the price of the foreign-made goods, they make them less competitive. The United States, for example, protects domestic makers of synthetic knitted shirts by imposing a stiff tariff of 32.5 percent on imports. Tariffs are also used to raise revenue for a government. Shoe imports are worth $1.63 billion annually to the federal government.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-collins-fn03_017">Dustin Smith, “The Truth About Industrial Country Tariffs,” <em class="emphasis">Finance &amp; Development</em>, September 2002, <a class="link" href="http://www.imf.org/external/pubs./ft/fandd/2002/09/smith.htm">http://www.imf.org/external/pubs./ft/fandd/2002/09/smith.htm</a> (accessed May 25, 2006).</span></p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Quotas</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch03_s04_s02_p01">A <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">quota</a><span class="glossdef">Government-imposed restrictions on the quantity of a good that can be imported over a period of time.</span></span> imposes limits on the quantity of a good that can be imported over a period of time. Quotas are used to protect specific industries, usually new industries or those facing strong competitive pressure from foreign firms. U.S. import quotas take two forms. An <em class="emphasis">absolute quota</em> fixes an upper limit on the amount of a good that can be imported during the given period. A <em class="emphasis">tariff-rate quota</em> permits the import of a specified quantity and then adds a high import tax once the limit is reached.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch03_s04_s02_p02">Sometimes quotas protect one group at the expense of another. To protect sugar beet and sugar cane growers, for instance, the United States imposes a tariff-rate quota on the importation of sugar—a policy that has driven up the cost of sugar to five times its actual price.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-collins-fn03_018">See William F. Buckley, “W.T.O. at Bat,” <em class="emphasis">Uexpress</em>, <a class="link" href="http://www.townhall.com/opinion/columns/wfbuckley/2003/12/06/160423.html">http://www.townhall.com/opinion/columns/wfbuckley/2003/12/06/160423.html</a> (accessed May 25, 2006).</span> These artificially high prices push up costs for American candy makers, some of whom have moved their operations elsewhere, taking high-paying manufacturing jobs with them. Life Savers, for example, were made in the United States for ninety years but are now produced in Canada, where the company saves $10 million annually on the cost of sugar.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-collins-fn03_019">See George Will, “Sugar Quotas Produce Sour Results,” <em class="emphasis">Detroit News</em>, February 13, 2004, <a class="link" href="http://www.detnews.com/2004/editorial/0402/15/all-62634.htm">http://www.detnews.com/2004/editorial/0402/15/all-62634.htm</a> (accessed October 17, 2004).</span></p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Dumping</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch03_s04_s03_p01">A common political rationale for establishing tariffs and quotas is the need to combat <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">dumping</a><span class="glossdef">Practice of selling exported goods below the price that producers would normally charge home markets.</span></span>: the practice of selling exported goods below the price that producers would normally charge in their home markets (and often below the cost of producing the goods). Usually, nations resort to this practice to gain entry and market share in foreign markets, but it can also be used to sell off surplus or obsolete goods. Dumping creates unfair competition for domestic industries, and governments are justifiably concerned when they suspect foreign countries of dumping products on their markets. They often retaliate by imposing punitive tariffs that drive up the price of the imported goods.</p>

    <div class="section" id="collins-ch03_s04_s04">
        <h2 class="title editable block">The Pros and Cons of Trade Controls</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch03_s04_s04_p01">Opinions vary on government involvement in international trade. Some experts believe that governments should support free trade and refrain from imposing regulations that restrict the free flow of goods and services between nations. Others argue that governments should impose some level of trade regulations on imported goods and services.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch03_s04_s04_p02">Proponents of controls contend that there are a number of legitimate reasons why countries engage in protectionism. Sometimes they restrict trade to protect specific industries and their workers from foreign competition—agriculture, for example, or steel making. At other times, they restrict imports to give new or struggling industries a chance to get established. Finally, some countries use protectionism to shield industries that are vital to their national defense, such as shipbuilding and military hardware.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch03_s04_s04_p03">Despite valid arguments made by supporters of trade controls, most experts believe that such restrictions as tariffs and quotas—as well as practices that don’t promote level playing fields, such as subsidies and dumping—are detrimental to the world economy. Without impediments to trade, countries can compete freely. Each nation can focus on what it does best and bring its goods to a fair and open world market. When this happens, the world will prosper. Or so the argument goes. International trade hasn’t achieved global prosperity, but it’s certainly heading in the direction of unrestricted markets.</p>

            <p class="para" id="collins-ch03_s04_s04_p04">Because the United States has placed quotas on textile and apparel imports for the last thirty years, certain countries, such as China and India, have been able to export to the United States only as much clothing as their respective quotas permit. One effect of this policy was spreading textile and apparel manufacture around the world and preventing any single nation from dominating the world market. As a result, many developing countries, such as Vietnam, Cambodia, and Honduras, were able to enter the market and provide much-needed jobs for local workers. The rules, however, have changed: as of January 1, 2005, quotas on U.S. textile imports were eliminated, permitting U.S. companies to import textile supplies from any country they choose.

To rectify this situation, twenty-three nations joined together in 1947 and signed the <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT)</a><span class="glossdef">International trade agreement that encourages free trade by regulating and reducing tariffs and provides a forum for resolving trade disputes.</span></span>, which encouraged free trade by regulating and reducing tariffs and by providing a forum for resolving trade disputes. The highly successful initiative achieved substantial reductions in tariffs and quotas, and in 1995 its members founded the World Trade Organization to continue the work of GATT in overseeing global trade.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch03_s05_s01_s02_p01">Based in Geneva, Switzerland, with nearly 150 members, the <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">World Trade Organization (WTO)</a><span class="glossdef">International organization that monitors trade policies and whose members work together to enforce rules of trade and resolve trade disputes.</span></span> encourages global commerce and lower trade barriers, enforces international rules of trade, and provides a forum for resolving disputes. It is empowered, for instance, to determine whether a member nation’s trade policies have violated the organization’s rules, and it can direct “guilty” countries to remove disputed barriers (though it has no legal power to force any country to do anything it doesn’t want to do). If the guilty party refuses to comply, the WTO may authorize the plaintiff nation to erect trade barriers of its own, generally in the form of tariffs.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch03_s05_s01_s02_p02">Affected members aren’t always happy with WTO actions. In 2002, for example, the Bush administration imposed a three-year tariff on imported steel. In ruling against this tariff, the WTO allowed the aggrieved nations to impose counter-tariffs on some politically sensitive American products, such as Florida oranges, Texas grapefruits and computers, and Wisconsin cheese. Reluctantly, the administration lifted its tariff on steel.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-collins-fn03_020">See William F.

There are, however, strings attached to IMF loans: in exchange for relief in times of financial crisis, borrower countries must institute sometimes painful financial and economic reforms. In the 1980s, for example, Mexico received financial relief from the IMF on the condition that it privatize and deregulate certain industries and liberalize trade policies. The government was also required to cut back expenditures for such services as education, health care, and workers’ benefits.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-collins-fn03_021">Bernard Sanders, “The International Monetary Fund Is Hurting You,” <em class="emphasis">Z Magazine</em>, July–August 1998, <a class="link" href="http://www.thirdworldtraveler.com/IMF_WB/IMF_Sanders.html">http://www.thirdworldtraveler.com/IMF_WB/IMF_Sanders.html</a> (accessed May 25, 2006).</span></p>

Some observers assert that too many World Bank loans go to environmentally harmful projects, such as the construction of roads through fragile rain forests. Others point to the World Bank’s efforts to direct funding away from big construction projects and toward initiatives designed to better the lot of the world’s poor—educating children, fighting AIDS, and improving nutrition and health standards.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Trading Blocs</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch03_s05_s03_p01">So far, our discussion has suggested that global trade would be strengthened if there were no restrictions on it—if countries didn’t put up barriers to trade or perform special favors for domestic industries. The complete absence of barriers is an ideal state of affairs that we haven’t yet attained. In the meantime, economists and policy makers tend to focus on a more practical question: Can we achieve the goal of free trade on the <em class="emphasis">regional</em> level? To an extent, the answer is yes. In certain parts of the world, groups of countries have joined together to allow goods and services to flow without restrictions across their mutual borders. Such groups are called <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">trading blocs</a><span class="glossdef">Groups of countries that have joined together to allow goods and services to flow without restrictions across their mutual borders.</span></span>. Let’s examine two of the most powerful trading blocks—NAFTA and the European Union.</p>
        <div class="section" id="collins-ch03_s05_s03_s01">

The effect of this agreement is that three very different economies are combined into one economic zone with almost no trade barriers. From the northern tip of Canada to the southern tip of Mexico, each country benefits from the comparative advantages of its partners: each nation is free to produce what it does best and to trade its goods and services without restrictions.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch03_s05_s03_s01_p02">When the agreement was ratified in 1994, it had no shortage of skeptics. Many people feared, for example, that without tariffs on Mexican goods, more U.S. manufacturing jobs would be lost to Mexico, where labor is cheaper. A decade later, most such fears have not been realized, and, by and large, NAFTA has been an enormous success. Since it went into effect, the value of trade between the United States and Mexico has grown substantially, and Canada and Mexico are now the United States’ top trading partners.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch03_s05_s03_s02_p01">The forty-plus countries of Europe have long shown an interest in integrating their economies. The first organized effort to integrate a segment of Europe’s economic entities began in the late 1950s, when six countries joined together to form the <em class="emphasis">European Economic Community</em> (EEC). Over the next four decades, membership grew, and in the late 1990s, the EEC became the European Union. Today, the <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">European Union (EU)</a><span class="glossdef">Association of European countries that joined together to eliminate trade barriers among themselves.</span></span> is a group of twenty-seven countries that have eliminated trade barriers among themselves (see the map in <a class="xref" href="#collins-ch03_s05_s03_s02_f01">Figure 3.11 "The Nations of the European Union"</a>).</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch03_s05_s03_s02_p02">At first glance, the EU looks similar to NAFTA. Both, for instance, allow unrestricted trade among member nations. But the provisions of the EU go beyond those of NAFTA in several important ways. Most importantly, the EU is more than a trading organization: it also enhances political and social cooperation and binds its members into a single entity with authority to require them to follow common rules and regulations. It is much like a federation of states with a weak central government, with the effect not only of eliminating internal barriers but also of enforcing common tariffs on trade from outside the EU. In addition, while NAFTA allows goods and services as well as capital to pass between borders, the EU also allows <em class="emphasis">people</em> to come and go freely: if you possess an EU passport, you can work in any EU nation.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch03_s05_s03_s03_p01">Many EU initiatives have been less successful than those of NAFTA, yet it can claim at least one very important exception: the introduction of a common currency. A key step toward unification occurred in 1999, when most (but not all) EU members agreed to abandon their own currencies and adopt a joint currency. The actual conversion occurred in 2002, when a common currency called the <em class="emphasis">euro</em> replaced the separate currencies of participating EU countries. The common currency facilitates trade and finance because exchange-rate differences no longer complicate transactions.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-collins-fn03_022">See “The Euro: The Basis for an Undeniable Competitive Advantage,” <a class="link" href="http://www.investinwallonia.be/an/marche_euro01.htm">http://www.investinwallonia.be/an/marche_euro01.htm</a> (accessed May 25, 2006).</span></p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch03_s05_s03_s04_p01">Other countries have also opted for economic integration. Four historical rivals in South America—Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay, and Uruguay—have established MERCOSUR (for <em class="emphasis">Mercado Commun del Sur</em>) to eliminate trade barriers. A number of Asian countries, including Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, and Thailand, are cooperating to reduce mutual barriers through ASEAN (the <em class="emphasis">Association of Southeast Asian Nations</em>).</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch03_s05_s03_s04_p02">Only time will tell whether the trend toward regional trade agreements is good for the world economy. Clearly, they’re beneficial to their respective participants; for one thing, they get preferential treatment from other members. But certain questions still need to be answered more fully. Are regional agreements, for example, moving the world closer to free trade on a <em class="emphasis">global</em> scale—toward a marketplace in which goods and services can be traded anywhere without barriers?</p>

We’re all involved in it. Some readers may want to venture more seriously into this exciting arena. The career opportunities are exciting and challenging, but taking the best advantage of them requires some early planning. Here are some hints.</p>
    <div class="section" id="collins-ch03_s06_s01">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Plan Your Undergraduate Education</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch03_s06_s01_p01">Many colleges and universities offer strong majors in international business, and this course of study can be good preparation for a global career. In planning your education, remember the following:</p>
        <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="collins-ch03_s06_s01_l01">
            <li>
<em class="emphasis">Develop real expertise in one of the basic areas of business</em>. Most companies will hire you as much for your skill and knowledge in accounting, finance, information systems, marketing, or management as for your background in the study of international business. Take courses in both areas.</li>
            <li>
<em class="emphasis">Develop your knowledge of international politics, economics, and culture</em>. Take liberal arts courses that focus on parts of the world that especially interest you. Courses in history, government, and the social sciences offer a wealth of knowledge about other nations and cultures that’s relevant to success in international business.</li>
            <li>
<em class="emphasis">Develop foreign-language skills</em>. If you studied a language in high school, keep up with it. Improve your reading or conversational skills. Or start a new language in college. Recall that your competition in the global marketplace is not just other Americans, but also individuals from countries, such as Belgium, where everyone’s fluent in at least two (and usually three) languages. Lack of foreign-language skills often proves to be a disadvantage for many Americans in international business.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <div class="section" id="collins-ch03_s06_s02">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Get Some Direct Experience</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch03_s06_s02_p01">Take advantage of study-abroad opportunities, whether offered on your campus or by another college. There are literally hundreds of such opportunities, and your interest in international business will be received much more seriously if you’ve spent some time abroad. (As a bonus, you’ll probably find it an enjoyable, horizon-expanding experience, as well.)</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section" id="collins-ch03_s06_s03">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Interact with People from Other Cultures</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch03_s06_s03_p01">Finally, whenever you can, learn about the habits and traits of other cultures, and practice interacting with the people to whom they belong. Go to the trouble to meet international students on your campus and get to know them. Learn about their cultures and values, and tell them about yours. You may initially be uncomfortable or confused in such intercultural exchanges, but you’ll find them great learning experiences. By picking up on the details, you’ll avoid embarrassing mistakes later and even earn the approval of acquaintances from abroad.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch03_s06_s03_p02">Whether you’re committed to a career in global business, curious about the international scene, or simply a consumer of worldwide products and services, you can’t avoid the effects of globalization. Granted, the experience can be frustrating, maybe even troubling at times. More often, however, it’s likely to be stimulating and full of opportunities.</p>

        <p class="para" id="collins-ch03_s07_p07">Because certain CDs are simply hard to get in the United States, over the years, you’ve gotten into the habit of buying a lot of music from a company located in Canada. You order CDs by mail and pay in Canadian currency, which you get at your local bank. They cost about $16 in Canadian dollars, and when you bought your first Canadian CD in 2002, US$1 could be converted into $1.60 in Canadian currency. At that conversion rate, you were getting CDs for about US$10. How much would you be paying at the current conversation rate? Would an American company that imports goods from Canada view the current rate more favorably or less favorably than it did back in 2002?</p>

        <p class="para" id="collins-ch03_s07_p09">Your father rarely throws anything away, and while cleaning out the attic a few years ago, he came across a pair of vintage Adidas soccer boots made in 1955. Realizing that they’d be extremely valuable to collectors in Adidas’s home country of Germany, he hoped to sell them for US$5,000 and, to account for the exchange rate at the time, planned to price them at $5,535 in euros. Somehow, he never got around to selling the boots and has asked if you could sell them for him on eBay. If he still wants to end up with US$5,000, what price in euros will you now have to set? Would an American company that exports goods to the European Union view the current rate more favorably or less favorably than it did back in 2002?</p>

        <p class="para" id="collins-ch03_s07_p10">At some point in your life, you’ll probably meet and work with people from various countries and cultures. Participating in a college study-abroad program can help you prepare to work in the global business environment, and now is as good a time as any to start exploring this option. Here’s one way to go about it:</p>
        <ul class="itemizedlist" id="collins-ch03_s07_l01">
            <li>
                <p class="para">Select a study-abroad program that interests you. To do this, you need to decide what country you want to study in and your academic field of interest. Unless you speak the language of your preferred country, you should pick a program offered in English.</p>

                    <li>If your school offers study-abroad programs, choose one that has been approved by your institution.</li>

                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Describe the program, the school that’s offering it, and the country to which it will take you.</li>
            <li>Indicate why you’ve selected this particular program, and explain how it will help you prepare for your future business career.</li>

Is dumping an unfair business practice? Why, or why not? Does subsidizing farmers make economic sense for the United States? What are the effects of farm subsidies on the world economy?

        <p class="para" id="collins-ch03_s07_p12">According to business journalists Pete Engardio and Dexter Roberts, the scariest three words that a U.S. manufacturer can hear these days are <em class="emphasis">the China price</em>. To understand why, go to the <em class="emphasis">Business Week</em> Web site (<a class="link" href="http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/04_49/b3911401.htm">http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/04_49/b3911401.htm</a>) and read its article “The China Price,” which discusses the benefits and costs of China’s business expansion for U.S. companies, workers, and consumers. Once you’ve read the article, each member of the team should be able to explain the paradoxical effect of U.S.–Chinese business relationships—namely, that they can hurt American companies and workers while helping American companies and consumers.</p>
        <p class="para" id="collins-ch03_s07_p13">Next, your team should get together and draw up two lists: a list of the top five positive outcomes and a list of the top five negative outcomes of recent Chinese business expansion for U.S. businesses, workers, and consumers. Then, the team should debate the pros and cons of China’s emergence as a global business competitor and, finally, write a group report that answers the following questions:</p>
        <ol class="orderedlist" id="collins-ch03_s07_l03">
            <li>Considered on balance, has China’s business expansion helped or harmed U.S. companies, workers, and consumers? Justify your answers.</li>
            <li>What will happen to U.S. companies, workers, and consumers in the future if China continues to grow as a global business competitor?</li>
            <li>How should U.S. companies respond to the threats posed by Chinese competitors in their markets?</li>
            <li>What can you do as a student to prepare yourself to compete in an ever-changing global business environment?</li>

        <p class="simpara"><strong class="emphasis bold">Go East, Young Job Seeker</strong></p>
        <p class="para" id="collins-ch03_s07_p15">How brave are you when it comes to employment? Are you bold enough to go halfway around the world to find work? Instead of complaining about U.S. jobs going overseas, you could take the bull by the horns and grab one job back. It’s not that tough to do, and it could be a life-changing experience. U.S. college graduates with business or technical backgrounds are highly sought after by companies that operate in India. If you qualify (and if you’re willing to relocate), you could find yourself working in Bangalore or New Delhi for some multinational company like Intel, Citibank, or GlaxoSmithKline (a pharmaceutical company). In addition, learning how to live and work in a foreign country can build self-confidence and make you more attractive to future employers. To get a glimpse of what it would be like to live and work in India, go to the Web sites of <em class="emphasis">American Way</em> magazine (<a class="link" href="http://americanwaymag.com/aw/business/feature.asp?archive_date=3/15/2005">http://americanwaymag.com/aw/business/feature.asp?archive_date=3/15/2005</a>) and CNN and Money (<a class="link" href="http://money.cnn.com/2004/03/09/pf/workers_to_india">http://money.cnn.com/2004/03/09/pf/workers_to_india</a>), and check out the posted articles: “Passage to India,” and “Needs Job, Moves to India.” Then, go to the Monster Work Abroad Web site (<a class="link" href="http://www.monster.com/geo/siteselection.asp">http://www.monster.com/geo/siteselection.asp</a>) and find a job in India that you’d like to have, either right after graduation or about five years into your career. (When selecting the job, ignore its actual location and proceed as if it’s in Bangalore.) After you’ve pondered the possibility of living and working in India, answer the following questions:</p>
        <ol class="orderedlist" id="collins-ch03_s07_l05">
            <li>What would your job entail?</li>
            <li>What would living and working in Bangalore be like? What aspects would you enjoy? Which would you dislike?</li>
            <li>What challenges would you face as an expatriate? What opportunities would you have?</li>
            <li>How would the experience of working in India help your future career?</li>
            <li>Would you be willing to take a job in India for a year or two? Why, or why not?</li>
