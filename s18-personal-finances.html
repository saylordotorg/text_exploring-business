    <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch14_p01">Do you wonder where your money goes? Do you have trouble controlling your spending? Have you run up the balances on your credit cards or gotten behind in your payments and hurt your credit rating? Do you worry about how you’ll pay off your student loans? Would you like to buy a new car or even a home someday and you’re not sure where the money will come from? If you do have extra money, do you know how to invest it? Do you know how to find the right job for you, land an offer, and evaluate the company’s benefits? If these questions seem familiar to you, you could benefit from help in managing your personal finances. This chapter will provide that help.</p>

You have a good education and a good job—you’re pulling down $60K working with a local accounting firm. You have $6,000 in a retirement savings account, and you carry three credit cards. You plan to buy a house (maybe a condo) in two or three years, and you want to take your dream trip to the world’s hottest surfing spots within five years (or, at the most, ten). Your only big worry is the fact that you’re $70,000 in debt, mostly from student loans, your car loan, and credit card debt. In fact, even though you’ve been gainfully employed for a total of six years now, you haven’t been able to make a dent in that $70,000. You can afford the necessities of life and then some, but you’ve occasionally wondered if you’re ever going to have enough income to put something toward that debt.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-collins-fn14_001">This vignette is adapted from a series entitled <em class="emphasis">USA TODAY’s Financial Diet</em>, which ran in <em class="emphasis">USA Today</em> in 2005 (accessed September 13, 2008).

        <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch14_s00_p02">Now let’s suppose that while browsing through a magazine in the doctor’s office, you run across a short personal-finances self-help quiz. There are two sets of three statements each, and you’re asked to check off each statement with which you <em class="emphasis">agree</em>:</p>
        <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="collins-ch14_s00_l02">
            <li>

            </li>
            <li>If I didn’t have a credit card in my pocket, I’d probably buy a lot less stuff.</li>
            <li>My credit card balance usually goes up at the holidays.</li>
            <li>If I really want something that I can’t afford, I put it on my credit card or sign up for a payment plan.</li>
        </ul>
        <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="collins-ch14_s00_l03">
            <li>
                <strong class="emphasis bold">Part 2</strong>
            </li>
            <li>I can barely afford my apartment.</li>
            <li>Whenever something goes wrong (car repairs, doctors’ bills), I have to use my credit card.</li>
            <li>I almost never spend money on stuff I don’t need, but I always seem to owe a balance on my credit card bill.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch14_s00_p03">At the bottom of the page, you’re asked whether you agreed with <em class="emphasis">any</em> of the statements in Part 1 and <em class="emphasis">any</em> of the statements in Part 2. It turns out that you answered yes in both cases and are thereby informed that you’re probably jeopardizing your entire financial future.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch14_s00_p04">Unfortunately, personal-finances experts tend to support the author of the quiz: if you agreed with any statement in Part 1, you have a problem with splurging; if you agreed with any statement in Part 2, your monthly bills are too high for your income.</p>
        <div class="section" id="collins-ch14_s00_s01">
            <h2 class="title editable block">Building a Good Credit Rating</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch14_s00_s01_p01">So, you have a financial problem: according to the quick test you took, you’re a splurger and your bills are too high for your income. How does this put you at risk? If you get in over your head and can’t make your loan or rent payments on time, you risk hurting your credit—your ability to borrow in the future.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch14_s00_s01_p02">Let’s talk about your credit. How do potential lenders decide whether you’re a good or bad credit risk? If you’re a poor credit risk, how does this affect your ability to borrow, or the rate of interest you have to pay, or both? Here’s the story. Whenever you use credit, those you borrow from (retailers, credit card companies, banks) provide information on your debt and payment habits to three national credit bureaus: Equifax, Experian, and TransUnion. The credit bureaus use the information to compile a numerical credit score, generally called a FICO score; it ranges from 300 to 900, with the majority of people falling in the 600–700 range. (Here’s a bit of trivia to bring up at a dull party: FICO stands for Fair Isaac Company—the company that developed the score.) In compiling the score, the credit bureaus consider five criteria: payment history—do you pay your bills on time? (the most important), total amount owed, length of your credit history, amount of new credit you have, and types of credit you use. The credit bureaus share their score and other information about your credit history with their subscribers.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch14_s00_s01_p03">So what does this do for you? It depends. If you paid your bills on time, carried only a reasonable amount of debt, didn’t max out your credit cards, had a history of borrowing, hadn’t applied for a bunch of new loans, and borrowed from a mix of lenders, you’d be in good shape. Your FICO score would be high and lenders would like you. Because of your high credit score, they’d give you the loans you asked for at reasonable interest rates. But if your FICO score is low (perhaps you weren’t so good at paying your bills on time), lenders won’t like you and won’t lend you money (or would lend it to you at high interest rates). So it’s very, very, very (the last “very” is for emphasis) important that you do everything possible to earn a high credit score. If you don’t know your score, here is what you should do: go to <a class="link" href="http://www.annualcreditreport.com">http://www.annualcreditreport.com</a> and request a free copy of your credit report. Your report won’t include your FICO score, but you can purchase your score for about $15.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch14_s00_s01_p04">As a young person, though, how do you get a high score? Start using credit now, but borrow sensibly. Get a credit card and use it to make small purchases and then pay your bill off on time. What if you’ve already damaged your credit score—what can you do to raise it? Do what you should have done in the first place: pay your bills on time, pay more than the minimum balance due on your credit cards and charge cards, keep your card balances low, and pay your debts off as quickly as possible. Also, scan your credit report for any errors. If you find any, work with the credit bureau to get them corrected.</p>

            <h2 class="title editable block">Understand the Cost of Borrowing</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch14_s00_s02_p01">Because your financial problem was brought on, in part, because you have too much debt, you should stop borrowing. But, what if your car keeps breaking down and you’re afraid of getting stuck on the road some night? So, you’re thinking of replacing it with a used car that costs $10,000. Before you make a final decision to incur the debt, you should understand its costs. The rate of interest matters a lot. Let’s compare three loans at varying interest rates: 6, 10, and 14 percent. We’ll look at the monthly payment, as well as the total interest paid over the life of the loan.</p>
            <div class="informaltable block" frame="all">

                    </tbody>

            </div>
            <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch14_s00_s02_p02">If your borrowing interest rate is 14 percent, rather than 6 percent, you’ll end up paying an additional $1,842 in interest over the life of the loan. Your borrowing cost at 14 percent is more than twice as much as it is at 6 percent. The conclusion: search for the best interest rates and add the cost of interest to the cost of whatever you’re buying before deciding whether you want it and can afford it. If you have to borrow the money for the car at the 14 percent interest rate, then the true cost of the car isn’t $10,000, but rather $13,114.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch14_s00_s02_p03">Now, let’s explore the complex world of credit cards. First extremely important piece of information: not all credit cards are equal. Second extremely important piece of information: watch out for credit card fees! Credit cards are a way of life for most of us. But they can be very costly. Before picking a credit card, do your homework. A little research can save you a good deal of money. There are a number of costs you need to consider:</p>
            <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="collins-ch14_s00_s02_l01">
                <li>
<em class="emphasis">Finance charge</em>. The interest rate charged to you often depends on your credit history; those with good credit get the best rates. Some cards offer low “introductory” rates—but watch out; these rates generally go up after six months.</li>
                <li>
<em class="emphasis">Annual fee</em>. Many credit cards charge an annual fee: a yearly charge for using the card. You can avoid annual fees by shopping around (though there can be trade-offs: you might end up paying a higher interest rate to avoid an annual fee).</li>
                <li>
<em class="emphasis">Over-limit fee</em>. This fee is charged whenever you exceed your credit line.</li>
                <li>
<em class="emphasis">Late payment fee</em>. Pretty self-explanatory, but also annoying. Late payment fees are common for students; a study found students account for 6 percent of all overdraft fees.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-collins-fn14_002">Harriet Johnson Brackey, “Students burdened by overdraft charges, group says,” YoungMoney, <a class="link" href="http://www.youngmoney.com/money_management/saving/184">http://www.youngmoney.com/money_management/saving/184</a> (accessed August 24, 2008).</span> One way to decrease the chance of paying late is to call the credit card company and ask them to set your payment due date for a time that works well for you. For example, if you get paid at the end of the month, ask for a payment date around the 10th of the month. Then you can pay your bill when you get paid and avoid a late fee.</li>
                <li>
<em class="emphasis">Cash advance fee</em>. While it’s tempting to get cash from your credit card, it’s pretty expensive. You’ll end up paying a fee (around 3 percent of the advance), and the interest rate charged on the amount borrowed can be fairly high.</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch14_s00_s02_p04">An alternative to a credit card is a <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">debit card</a><span class="glossdef">Pulls money out of your checking account whenever you use the card to buy something or get cash from an ATM.</span></span>, which pulls money out of your checking account whenever you use the card to buy something or get cash from an ATM. These cards don’t create a loan when used. So, are they better than credit cards? It depends—each has its advantages and disadvantages. A big advantage of a credit card is that it helps you build credit. A disadvantage is that you can get in over your head in debt and possibly miss payments (thereby incurring a late payment fee). Debit cards help control spending. Theoretically, you can’t spend more than you have in your checking account. But be careful—if you don’t keep track of your checking account balance, it’s easy to overdraft your account when using your debit card. In the past, banks would just reject purchases or ATM withdrawals if a customer didn’t have enough money in his or her account to cover the transaction. Recently, though, some banks are accepting the transaction and then charging a checking account overdraft fee of about $25.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-collins-fn14_003">Kathy Chu,” Debit card overdraft fees hit record highs,” <em class="emphasis">USA Today</em>, January 24, 2007, <a class="link" href="http://www.usatoday.com/money/perfi/credit/2007-01-24-debit-card-fees_x.htm">http://www.usatoday.com/money/perfi/credit/2007-01-24-debit-card-fees_x.htm</a> (accessed August 30, 2008).</span> This can be quite expensive, particularly if you used the card to purchase a hamburger and soda at a fast-food restaurant.</p>

            <h2 class="title editable block">A Few More Words about Debt</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch14_s00_s03_p01">What should you do now to turn things around—to start getting out of debt? According to many experts, you need to take two steps:</p>
            <ol class="orderedlist editable block" id="collins-ch14_s00_s03_l01">
                <li>Cut up your credit cards and start living on a cash-only basis.</li>
                <li>Do whatever you can to bring down your monthly bills.</li>
            </ol>

            <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch14_s00_s03_p02">Step 1 in this abbreviated two-step personal-finances “plan” is probably the easier of the two, but taking even this step can be hard enough. In fact, a lot of people would find it painful to give up their credit cards, and there’s a perfectly logical reason for their reluctance: the degree of pain that one would suffer from destroying one’s credit cards probably stands in direct proportion to one’s reliance on them.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch14_s00_s03_p03">As of this writing, total credit card debt in the United States is about $790 billion, out of $2.6 trillion in total consumer debt. Closer to home, one recent report puts <em class="emphasis">average credit card debt per U.S. household</em> at $9,840 (up 25 percent since 2000).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-collins-fn14_004">Barry Wood, “US Credit Card Debt Rising as Other Sources Dry Up,” <em class="emphasis">VOA News</em>, February 26, 2008, <a class="link" href="http://www.voanews.com/english/archive/2008-02/2008-02-26-voa1.cfm?CFID=39187384&amp;CFTOKEN=10951195">http://www.voanews.com/english/archive/2008-02/2008-02-26-voa1.cfm?CFID=39187384&amp;CFTOKEN=10951195</a> (accessed September 13, 2008); Joshua Lipton, “Choking On Credit Card Debt,” <em class="emphasis">Forbes.com</em>, September 12, 2008, <a class="link" href="http://www.forbes.com/finance/2008/09/12/credit-card-debt-pf-ii-in_jl_0911creditcards_inl.html">http://www.forbes.com/finance/2008/09/12/credit-card-debt-pf-ii-in_jl_0911creditcards_inl.html</a> (accessed September 13, 2008).</span> Why are these numbers important? Primarily because, <em class="emphasis">on average</em>, too many consumers have debt that they simply can’t handle. “Credit card debt,” says one expert on the problem, “is clobbering millions of Americans like a wrecking ball,”<span class="footnote" id="fwk-collins-fn14_005">U.S. Senator Ron Wyden, quoted in “Avoiding the Pitfalls of Credit Card Debt” (Center for American Progress Action Fund, 2008), <a class="link" href="http://www.americanprogressaction.org/issues/2008/avoiding_pitfalls.html">http://www.americanprogressaction.org/issues/2008/avoiding_pitfalls.html</a> (accessed September 13, 2008).</span> and if you’re like most of us, you’d probably like to know whether your personal-finances habits are setting you up to become one of the clobbered.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch14_s00_s04_p02">If you want to take a gradual approach to step 2, one financial planner suggests that you perform the following “exercises” for one week:<span class="footnote" id="fwk-collins-fn14_008">Financial planner Elissa Buie helped to develop <em class="emphasis">USA TODAY’s Financial Diet</em>.</span></p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch14_s00_s04_p03">Among other things, you’ll probably be surprised at how much of your money can become somebody else’s money on a week-by-week basis. If, for example, you spend $3 every day for one cup of coffee at a coffee shop, you’re laying out nearly $1,100 a year. If you use your ATM card at a bank other than your own, you’ll probably be charged a fee that can be as high as $3. The average person pays more than $60 a year in ATM fees, and if you withdraw cash from an ATM twice a week, you could be racking up $300 in annual fees. As for your ATM receipts, they’ll tell you whether, on top of the fee that you’re charged by that other bank’s ATM, your <em class="emphasis">own</em> bank is <em class="emphasis">also</em> tacking on a surcharge.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-collins-fn14_009">Sun Trust Banks, “Money Management” (2008), <a class="link" href="http://www.suntrusteducation.com/toolbox/moneymgt_spendless.asp">http://www.suntrusteducation.com/toolbox/moneymgt_spendless.asp</a> (accessed September 16, 2008); “Reduce ATM Fees—Daily Financial Tip,” <em class="emphasis">SavingAdvice.com</em>, April 5, 2006, <a class="link" href="http://www.savingadvice.com/blog/2006/04/05/10533_reduce-atm-fees-daily-financial-tip.html">http://www.savingadvice.com/blog/2006/04/05/10533_reduce-atm-fees-daily-financial-tip.html</a> (accessed September 16, 2008); Marshall Loeb, “Four Ways to Keep ATM Fees from Draining Your Bank Account,” <em class="emphasis">MarketWatch</em> (June 14, 2007), <a class="link" href="http://www.marketwatch.com/news/story/four-ways-keep-atm-fees/story.aspx?guid=%7BEFB2C425-B7F8-40C4-8720-D684A838DBDA%7D">http://www.marketwatch.com/news/story/four-ways-keep-atm-fees/story.aspx?guid=%7BEFB2C425-B7F8-40C4-8720-D684A838DBDA%7D</a> (accessed September 16, 2008); Kate Rosenberger, “How to Avoid ATM Fees,” <em class="emphasis">Helium</em> (2008), <a class="link" href="http://www.helium.com/items/1100945-how-to-avoid-atm-fees">http://www.helium.com/items/1100945-how-to-avoid-atm-fees</a> (accessed September 16, 2008).</span></p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch14_s00_s04_p07">The great English writer Samuel Johnson once warned: “Do not accustom yourself to consider debt only as an inconvenience; you will find it a calamity.” In Johnson’s day, you could be locked up for failing to pay your debts; there were even so-called “debtor’s prisons” for the purpose, and we may suppose that the prospect of doing time for owing money was one of the things that Johnson had in mind when he spoke of debt as a potential “calamity.” We don’t expect that you’ll ever go to prison on account of indebtedness, and we won’t suggest that, say, having to retire to a condo in the city instead of a tropical island is a “calamity.” We’ll simply say that you’re more likely to meet your lifetime financial goals—whatever they are—if you plan for them. What you need to know about planning for and reaching those goals is the subject of this chapter.</p>

                    <li>Before buying something on credit, ask yourself whether you really need the goods or services, can afford them, and are willing to pay interest on the purchase.</li>
                    <li>Whenever you use credit, those you borrow from provide information on your debt and payment habits to three national credit bureaus.</li>
                    <li>The credit bureaus use the information to compile a numerical credit score, called a FICO score, which they share with subscribers.</li>
                    <li>The credit bureaus consider five criteria in compiling the score: payment history, total amount owed, length of your credit history, amount of new credit you have, and types of credit you use.</li>
                    <li>To raise your credit score, you should pay your bills on time, pay more than the minimum balance due, keep your card balances low, and pay your debts off as quickly as possible. Also, scan your credit report for any errors and get any errors fixed.</li>
                    <li>If you can’t pay your debt, explain your situation to your lenders and see a credit assistance counselor.</li>
                    <li>Before you incur a debt, you should understand its costs. The interest rate charged by the lender makes a big difference in the overall cost of the loan.</li>

    <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch14_s01_p01">Before we go any further, we need to nail down a couple of key concepts. First, just what, exactly, do we mean by personal finances? <em class="emphasis">Finance</em> itself concerns the flow of money from one place to another, and your personal finances concern your money and what you plan to do with it as it flows in and out of your possession. Essentially, then, <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">personal finance</a><span class="glossdef"><strong class="emphasis bold">The application of financial principles to the monetary decisions of an individual or a family</strong>.</span></span> is the application of financial principles to the monetary decisions that you make either for your individual benefit or for that of your family.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch14_s01_p02">Second, as we suggested in the previous section of this chapter—and as we’ll insist in the rest of it—monetary decisions work out much more beneficially when they’re planned rather than improvised. Thus our emphasis on <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">financial planning</a><span class="glossdef"><strong class="emphasis bold">The process of managing your personal finances to meet goals that you’ve set for yourself or your family</strong>.</span></span>—the ongoing process of managing your personal finances in order to meet goals that you’ve set for yourself or your family.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch14_s01_p03">Financial planning requires you to address several questions, some of them relatively simple:</p>
    <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="collins-ch14_s01_l02">
        <li>What’s my annual income?</li>
        <li>How much debt do I have, and what are my monthly payments on that debt?</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch14_s01_p04">Others will require some investigation and calculation:</p>
    <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="collins-ch14_s01_l03">
        <li>What’s the value of my assets?</li>
        <li>How can I best budget my annual income?</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch14_s01_p05">Still others will require some forethought and forecasting:</p>
    <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="collins-ch14_s01_l04">
        <li>How much wealth can I expect to accumulate during my working lifetime?</li>

        <h2 class="title editable block">The Financial Planning Life Cycle</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch14_s01_s01_p01">Another question that you might ask yourself—and certainly would do if you were a professional in financial planning—is something like: “How will my financial plans change over the course of my life?” <a class="xref" href="#collins-ch14_s01_s01_f01">Figure 14.4 "Financial Life Cycle"</a> illustrates the financial life cycle of a typical individual—one whose financial outlook and likely outcomes are probably a lot like yours.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-collins-fn14_011">This section is based on Arthur J. Keown, <em class="emphasis">Personal Finance: Turning Money into Wealth</em>, 4th ed. (Upper Saddle River, NJ: Pearson Education, 2007), 8–11.</span> As you can see, our diagram divides this individual’s life into three stages, each of which is characterized by different life events (such as beginning a family, buying a home, planning an estate, retiring). At each stage, too, there are recommended changes in the focus of the individual’s financial planning:</p>
        <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="collins-ch14_s01_s01_l01">
            <li>In stage 1, the focus is on building wealth.</li>
            <li>In stage 2, the focus shifts to the process of preserving and increasing the wealth that one has accumulated and continues to accumulate.</li>
            <li>In stage 3, the focus turns to the process of living on (and, if possible, continuing to grow) one’s saved wealth.</li>
        </ul>

        <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch14_s01_s01_p02">At each stage, of course, complications can set in—say, changes in such conditions as marital or employment status or in the overall economic outlook.

For every $1 that you spend on your college education, you can expect to earn about $35 during the course of your financial life cycle.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-collins-fn14_014">See Katharine Hansen, “What Good Is a College Education Anyway?” <em class="emphasis">Quintessential Careers</em> (2008), <a class="link" href="http://www.quintcareers.com/college_education_value.html">http://www.quintcareers.com/college_education_value.html</a> (accessed September 18, 2008).</span> At that rate of return, you should be able to pay off your student loans (unless, of course, you fail to practice reasonable financial planning).</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch14_s01_s01_s01_p05">Naturally, there are exceptions to these average outcomes. You’ll find English-lit majors stocking shelves at 7-Eleven, and you’ll find college dropouts running multibillion-dollar enterprises. Microsoft cofounder Bill Gates dropped out of college after two years, as did his founding partner, Paul Allen. Current Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer finished his undergraduate degree but quit his MBA program to join Microsoft (where he apparently fit in among the other dropouts in top management). It’s always good to remember, however, that though exceptions to rules (and average outcomes) occasionally modify the rules, they invariably fall far short of disproving them: in entrepreneurship as in most other walks of adult life, the better your education, the more promising your financial future. One expert in the field puts the case for the average person bluntly: educational credentials “are about being employable, becoming a legitimate candidate for a job with a future. They are about climbing out of the dead-end job market.”<span class="footnote" id="fwk-collins-fn14_015">John G.

To a perhaps surprising extent, not necessarily. Some career areas, such as engineering, architecture, teaching, and law, require targeted degrees, but the area of study designated on your degree often doesn’t matter much when you’re applying for a job. If, for instance, a job ad says, “Business, communications, or other degree required,” most applicants and hires will have those “other” degrees. When poring over résumés for a lot of jobs, potential employers look for the degree and simply note that a candidate has one; they often don’t need to focus on the particulars.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-collins-fn14_016">See J.

        <h2 class="title editable block">Financing a College Education</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch14_s01_s02_p01">Let’s revisit one of the facts included in the earlier discussion: for every $1 that you spend on your college education, you can expect to earn about $35 during the course of your financial life cycle. And let’s say you’re convinced (as you should be) that getting a college degree is a wise financial choice. You still have to deal with the cost of getting your degree. We’re sure this won’t come as a surprise: attending college is expensive—tuition and fees have gone up sharply, the cost of books has skyrocketed, and living expenses have climbed. Many students can attend college only if they receive some type of financial aid. Though the best way to learn what aid is available to you is to talk with a representative in the financial aid office at your school, this section provides an overview of the types of aid offered to students. Students finance their education through scholarships, grants, education loans, and work-study programs.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-collins-fn14_018">Denise Witmer, “The Basics of Financial Aid for College,” About.com, <a class="link" href="http://parentingteens.about.com/od/collegeinfo/a/financial_aid.htm">http://parentingteens.about.com/od/collegeinfo/a/financial_aid.htm</a> (accessed August 30, 2008).</span> We’ll explore each of these categories of aid:</p>

            <li>
<em class="emphasis">Scholarships</em>, which don’t have to be repaid, are awarded based on a number of criteria, including academic achievement, athletic or artistic talent, special interest in a particular field of study, ethnic background, or religious affiliation. Scholarships are generally funded by private donors such as alums, religious institutions, companies, civic organizations, professional associations, and foundations.</li>
            <li>
<em class="emphasis">Grants</em>, which also don’t have to be repaid, are awarded based on financial need. They’re funded by the federal government, the states, and academic institutions. An example of a common federal grant is the Pell Grant, which is awarded to undergraduate students based on financial need. The maximum Pell Grant award for the 2008–2009 award year (July 1, 2008, to June 30, 2009) is $4,731.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-collins-fn14_019">Federal Student Aid, <a class="link" href="http://studentaid.ed.gov/PORTALSWebApp/students/english/PellGrants.jsp">http://studentaid.ed.gov/PORTALSWebApp/students/english/PellGrants.jsp</a> (accessed August 30, 2008).</span>

            <li>
<em class="emphasis">Education loans</em>, which must be repaid, are available to students from various sources, including the federal government, states, and academic institutions.

With the exception of the unsubsidized Federal Stafford, no interest accrues while the student is enrolled in college at least part time. There are also a number of loans available to parents of students, such as the Federal PLUS program. Under this program, parents can borrow federally guaranteed low-interest loans to fund their child’s education.</li>

        <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch14_s01_s03_p01">As was highlighted earlier, your financial life cycle begins at the point when you choose a career. Building your career takes considerable planning. It begins with the selection of a major in college and continues through graduation as you enter the workforce full time. You can expect to hold a number of jobs over your working life. If things go as they should, each job will provide valuable opportunities and help you advance your career. A big challenge is getting a job offer in your field of interest, evaluating the offer, and (if you have several options) selecting the job that’s right for you.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-collins-fn14_021">This section is based in part on sections 13 and 14 of the Playbook for Life by The Hartford.

            <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch14_s01_s03_s01_p01">Most likely your college has a career center. The people working there can be a tremendous help to you as you begin your job search. But most of the work has to be done by you. Like other worthwhile projects, your job search project will be very time-consuming. As you get close to graduation, you’ll need to block out time to work on this particularly important task.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch14_s01_s03_s01_p02">The first step is to prepare a <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">résumé</a><span class="glossdef"><strong class="emphasis bold">A document that provides a summary of educational achievements and relevant job experience</strong>.</span></span>, a document that provides a summary of educational achievements and relevant job experience. Its purpose is to get you an interview. A potential employer will likely spend less than a minute reviewing your résumé, so its content should be concise, clear, and applicable to the job for which you’re applying. For some positions, the person in charge of hiring might read more than a hundred résumés. If you don’t want your résumé kicked out right away, be sure it contains no typographical or grammatical errors. Once you’ve completed your résumé, you can use it to create different versions tailored to specific companies you’d like to work for. Your next step is to write a <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">cover letter</a><span class="glossdef"><strong class="emphasis bold">A document accompanying your résumé that explains why you’re sending your résumé and highlights your qualifications</strong>.</span></span>, a document accompanying your résumé that explains why you’re sending your résumé and highlights your qualifications. You can find numerous tips on writing résumés and cover letters (as well as samples of both) online. Be sure your résumé is accurate: never lie or exaggerate in a résumé. You could get caught and not get the job (or—even worse—you could get the job, get caught, and then get fired). It’s fairly common practice for companies to conduct background checks of possible employees, and these checks will point out any errors. In effect, says one expert, “you jeopardize your future when you lie about your past.”<span class="footnote" id="fwk-collins-fn14_022">Kim Isaacs, “Lying on Your Resume: What Are the Career Consequences?,” Monster.com, <a class="link" href="http://career-advice.monster.com/resume-writing-basics/Lying-on-Your-Resume/home.aspx">http://career-advice.monster.com/resume-writing-basics/Lying-on-Your-Resume/home.aspx</a> (accessed August 30, 2008).</span></p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch14_s01_s03_s01_p03">After writing your résumé and cover letter, your next task is to create a list of companies you’d like to work for. Use a variety of sources, including your career services office and company Web sites, to decide which companies to put on your list. Visit the “career or employment” section of the company Web sites and search for specific openings.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch14_s01_s03_s01_p04">You could also conduct a general search for positions that might be of interest to you, by doing the following:</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch14_s01_s03_s01_p06">When you’re invited for an interview, visit to the company’s Web site and learn as much as you can about the company. Practice answering questions you might be asked during the interview, and think up a few pertinent questions to ask your interviewer. Dress conservatively—males should wear a suit and tie and females should wear professional-looking clothes. Try to relax during the interview (though everyone knows this isn’t always easy). Your goal is to get an offer, so let the interviewer learn who you are and how you can be an asset to the company. Send a thank-you note (or thank-you e-mail) to the interviewer after the interview.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch14_s01_s03_s02_p01">Let’s be optimistic and say that you did quite well in your interviews, and you have two job offers. It’s a great problem to have, but now you have to decide which one to accept. Salary is important, but it’s clearly not the only factor. You should consider the opportunities the position offers: will you learn new things on the job, how much training will you get, could you move up in the organization (and if so, how quickly)? Also consider quality of life issues: how many hours a week will you have to work, is your schedule predictable (or will you be asked to work on a Friday night or Saturday at the last minute), how flexible is your schedule, how much time do you get off, how stressful will the job be, do you like the person who will be your manager, do you like your coworkers, how secure is the job, how much travel is involved, where’s the company located, and what’s the cost of living in that area? Finally, consider the financial benefits you’ll receive. These could include health insurance, disability insurance, flexible spending accounts, and retirement plans. Let’s talk more about the financial benefits, beginning with health insurance.</p>
            <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="collins-ch14_s01_s03_s02_l01">
                <li>
<span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Employer-sponsored health insurance</a><span class="glossdef"><em class="emphasis">Insurance plan paid for by the employer that covers medical care for the employee only, or for the employee, spouse, and children</em>.</span></span> plans vary greatly. Some cover the employee only, while others cover the employee, spouse, and children. Some include dental and eye coverage while others don’t. Most plans require employees to share some of the cost of the medical plan (by paying a portion of the insurance premiums and a portion of the cost of medical care). But the amount that employees are responsible for varies greatly. Given the rising cost of health insurance, it’s important to understand the specific costs associated with a health care plan and to take these costs into account when comparing job offers. More important, it’s vital that you have medical insurance. Young people are often tempted to go without medical insurance, but this is a major mistake. An uncovered, costly medical emergency (say you’re rushed to the hospital with appendicitis) can be a financial disaster. You could end up paying for your hospital and doctor care for years.</li>
                <li>
<span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Disability insurance</a><span class="glossdef">Pays an income to an insured person when he or she is unable to work for an extended period.</span></span> isn’t as well known as medical insurance, but it can be as important (if not more so). Disability insurance pays an income to an insured person when he or she is unable to work for an extended period. You would hope that you’d never need disability insurance, but if you did it would be of tremendous value.</li>
                <li>A <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">flexible spending account</a><span class="glossdef">Allows a specified amount of pretax dollars to be used to pay for qualified expenses, including health care and child care.</span></span> allows a specified amount of pretax dollars to be used to pay for qualified expenses, including health care and child care.

                <li>There are two main types of <em class="emphasis">retirement plans</em>. One, called a <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">defined benefit plan</a><span class="glossdef">Provides a set amount of money each month to retirees based on the number of years they worked and the income they earned.</span></span>, provides a set amount of money each month to retirees based on the number of years they worked and the income they earned.

The other, called a <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">defined contribution plan</a><span class="glossdef">A form of retirement savings plan in which both the employee and the employer may contribute.</span></span>, is a form of savings plan. The employee contributes money each pay period to his or her retirement account, and the employer matches a portion of the contribution. Even when retirement is exceedingly far into the future, it’s financially wise to set aside funds for retirement.</li>

                        <p class="para">The <em class="emphasis">financial life cycle</em> divides an individual’s life into three stages, each of which is characterized by different life events. Each stage also entails recommended changes in the focus of the individual’s financial planning:</p>
                        <ol class="orderedlist" id="collins-ch14_s01_s03_s02_l03">
                            <li>In stage 1, the focus is on <em class="emphasis">building</em> wealth.</li>
                            <li>In stage 2, the focus shifts to the process of <em class="emphasis">preserving and increasing</em> the wealth that one has accumulated and continues to accumulate.</li>
                            <li>In stage 3, the focus turns to the process of <em class="emphasis">living on</em> (and, if possible, continuing to grow) one’s saved wealth.</li>

                    <li>College is a good investment of both money and time. People who graduate from high school can expect to improve their average annual earnings by about 49 percent over those of people who don’t, and those who go on to finish college can expect to generate 82 percent more annual income than that. The area of study designated on your degree often doesn’t matter when you’re applying for a job: when poring over résumés, employers often look for the degree and simply note that a candidate has one.</li>
                    <li>The first step in your job search is to prepare a <strong class="emphasis bold">résumé</strong>, a document that provides a summary of educational achievements and relevant job experience.

    </div>
    <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch14_s02_p01">The fact that you have to choose a career at an early stage in your financial life cycle isn’t the only reason that you need to start early on your financial planning. Let’s assume, for instance, that it’s your eighteenth birthday and that on this day you take possession of $10,000 that your grandparents put in trust for you. You could, of course, spend it; in particular, it would probably cover the cost of flight training for a private pilot’s license—something you’ve always wanted but were convinced that you couldn’t afford for another ten or fifteen years. Your grandfather, of course, suggests that you put it into some kind of savings account. If you just wait until you finish college, he says, and if you can find a savings plan that pays 5 percent interest, you’ll have the $10,000 plus another $2,209 to buy a pretty good used car.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch14_s02_p02">The total amount you’ll have— $12,209—piques your interest. If that $10,000 could turn itself into $12,209 after sitting around for four years, what would it be worth if you actually held on to it until you did retire—say, at age sixty-five? A quick trip to the Internet to find a compound-interest calculator informs you that, forty-seven years later, your $10,000 will have grown to $104,345 (assuming a 5 percent interest rate). That’s not really enough to retire on, but after all, you’d at least have some cash, even if you hadn’t saved another dime for nearly half a century. On the other hand, what if that four years in college had paid off the way you planned, so that (once you get a good job) you’re able to add, say, another $10,000 to your retirement savings account every year until age sixty-five? At that rate, you’ll have amassed a nice little nest egg of slightly more than $1.6 million.</p>
    <div class="section" id="collins-ch14_s02_s01">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Compound Interest</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch14_s02_s01_p01">In your efforts to appreciate the potential of your $10,000 to multiply itself, you have acquainted yourself with two of the most important concepts in finance. As we’ve already indicated, one is the principle of <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">compound interest</a><span class="glossdef">Interest earned on your savings is added to the money in your savings account, and the new total (principle plus interest) earns more interest.</span></span>, which refers to the effect of earning interest on your interest.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch14_s02_s01_p02">Let’s say, for example, that you take your grandfather’s advice and invest your $10,000 (your <em class="emphasis">principal</em>) in a savings account at an annual interest rate of 5 percent. Over the course of the first year, your investment will earn $512 in interest and grow to $10,512. If you now reinvest the entire $10,512 at the same 5 percent annual rate, you’ll earn another $537 in interest, giving you a total investment at the end of year 2 of $11,049. And so forth. And that’s how you can end up with $104,345 at age sixty-five.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section" id="collins-ch14_s02_s02">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Time Value of Money</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch14_s02_s02_p01">You’ve also encountered the principle of the <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">time value of money</a><span class="glossdef">The principle whereby a dollar received in the present is worth more than a dollar received in the future.</span></span>—the principle whereby a dollar received in the present is worth more than a dollar received in the future. If there’s one thing that we’ve stressed throughout this chapter so far, it’s the fact that, for better or for worse, most people prefer to consume now rather than in the future. This is true for both borrowers and lenders. If you borrow money from me, it’s because you can’t otherwise buy something that you want at the present time. If I lend it to you, it’s because I’m willing to postpone the opportunity to purchase something I want at the present time—perhaps a risk-free, ten-year U.S. Treasury bond with a present yield rate of 3 percent.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch14_s02_s02_p02">I’m willing to forego my opportunity, however, only if I can get some compensation for its loss, and that’s why I’m going to charge you interest. And you’re going to pay the interest because you need the money to buy what you want to buy. How much interest should we agree on? In theory, it could be just enough to cover the cost of my lost opportunity, but there are, of course, other factors. Inflation, for example, will have eroded the value of my money by the time I get it back from you. In addition, while I would be taking no risk in loaning money to the U.S. government (as I would be doing if I bought that Treasury bond), I am taking a risk in loaning it to you. Our agreed-on rate will reflect such factors.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-collins-fn14_023">See Timothy J. Gallager and Joseph D. Andrews Jr., <em class="emphasis">Financial Management: Principles and Practice</em>, 3rd ed. (Upper Saddle River, NJ: Prentice Hall, 2003), 34, 196.</span></p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch14_s02_s02_p03">Finally, the time value of money principle also states that a dollar received today starts earning interest sooner than one received tomorrow. Let’s say, for example, that you receive $2,000 in cash gifts when you graduate from college. At age twenty-three, with your college degree in hand, you get a decent job and don’t have an immediate need for that $2,000. So you put it into an account that pays 10 percent compounded <em class="emphasis">and</em> you add another $2,000 ($167 per month) to your account every year for the next eleven years.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-collins-fn14_024">This 10 percent interest rate is not realistic for today’s economic environment. It’s used for illustrative purposes only.</span> The left panel of <a class="xref" href="#collins-ch14_s02_s02_t01">Table 14.3 "Why to Start Saving Early (I)"</a> shows how much your account will earn each year and how much money you’ll have at certain ages between twenty-three and sixty-seven. As you can see, you’d have nearly $52,000 at age thirty-six and a little more than $196,000 at age fifty; at age sixty-seven, you’d be just a bit short of $1 million. The right panel of the same table shows what you’d have if you hadn’t started saving $2,000 a year until you were age thirty-six. As you can also see, you’d have a respectable sum at age sixty-seven—but less than half of what you would have accumulated by starting at age twenty-three. More important, even to accumulate that much, <em class="emphasis">you’d have to add $2,000 per year for a total of thirty-two years, not just twelve</em>.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch14_s02_s02_p04">Here’s another way of looking at the same principle. Suppose that you’re twenty years old, don’t have $2,000, and don’t want to attend college full-time. You are, however, a hard worker and a conscientious saver, and one of your (very general) financial goals is to accumulate a $1 million retirement nest egg. As a matter of fact, if you can put $33 a month into an account that pays 12 percent interest compounded,<span class="footnote" id="fwk-collins-fn14_025">This 12 percent rate is unrealistic in today’s economic environment. It’s used for illustrative purposes only.</span> you can have your $1 million by age sixty-seven. That is, <em class="emphasis">if you start at age twenty</em>. As you can see from <a class="xref" href="#collins-ch14_s02_s02_t02">Table 14.4 "Why to Start Saving Early (II)"</a>, if you wait until you’re twenty-one to start saving, you’ll need $37 a month. If you wait until you’re thirty, you’ll have to save $109 a month, and if you procrastinate until you’re forty, the ante goes up to $366 a month.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-collins-fn14_026">See Arthur J.

                <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="collins-ch14_s03_s01_s01_s02_l01">
                    <li>Anything that Joe owes on such items as his furniture and computer are <em class="emphasis">current liabilities</em>—debts that must be paid within one year. Much of this indebtedness no doubt ends up on Joe’s credit card balance, which is regarded as a current liability because he <em class="emphasis">should</em> pay it off within a year.</li>
                    <li>By contrast, his car payments and student-loan payments are <em class="emphasis">noncurrent liabilities</em>—debt payments that extend for a period of more than one year. Joe is in no position to buy a house, but for most people, their mortgage is their most significant noncurrent liability.</li>
                </ul>
                <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch14_s03_s01_s01_s02_p02">Finally, note that Joe has positive net worth. At this point in the life of the average college student, positive net worth may be a little unusual. If you happen to have negative net worth right now, you’re technically <em class="emphasis">insolvent</em>, but remember that a major goal of getting a college degree is to enter the workforce with the best possible opportunity for generating enough wealth to reverse that situation.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch14_s03_s01_s02_p03">Joe has been able to maintain a positive cash flow for the year ending August 31, 2008, but he’s cutting it close. Moreover, he’s in the black only because of the inflow from student loans—income that, as you’ll recall from his net worth statement, is also a noncurrent liability. We are, however, willing to give Joe the benefit of the doubt: Though he’s incurring the high costs of an education, he’s willing to commit himself to the debt (and, we’ll assume, to careful spending) because he regards education as an investment that will pay off in the future.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch14_s03_s01_s02_p04">Remember that when constructing a cash-flow statement, you must record only income and expenditures that pertain to a given period, whether it be a month, a semester, or (as in Joe’s case) a year. Remember, too, that you must figure both inflows and outflows <em class="emphasis">on a cash basis</em>: you record income only when you receive money, and you record expenditures only when you pay out money. When, for example, Joe used his credit card to purchase his computer, he didn’t actually pay out any money. Each monthly payment on his credit card balance, however, is an outflow that must be recorded on his cash-flow statement (according to the type of expense – say, recreation/entertainment, food, transportation, and so on).</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch14_s03_s01_s02_p05">Your cash-flow statement, then, provides another perspective on your <em class="emphasis">solvency</em>: if you’re <em class="emphasis">insolvent</em>, it’s because you’re spending more than you’re earning. Ultimately, your net worth and cash-flow statements are most valuable when you use them together. While your net worth statement lets you know what you’re worth—how much wealth you have—your cash-flow statement lets you know precisely what effect your spending and saving habits are having on your wealth.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Step 2: Set Short-Term, Intermediate-Term, and Long-Term Financial Goals</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch14_s03_s02_p01">We know from Joe’s cash-flow statement that, despite his limited income, he feels that he can save $1,200 a year. He knows, of course, that it makes sense to have some cash in reserve in case of emergencies (car repairs, medical needs, and so forth), but he also knows that by putting away some of his money (probably each week), he’s developing a habit that he’ll need if he hopes to reach his long-term financial goals.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch14_s03_s02_p02">Just what are Joe’s goals? We’ve summarized them in <a class="xref" href="#collins-ch14_s03_s02_f01">Figure 14.9 "Joe’s Goals"</a>, where, as you can see, we’ve divided them into three time frames: short-term (less than two years), intermediate-term (two to five years), and long-term (more than five years). Though Joe is still in an early stage of his financial life cycle, he has identified and structured his goals fairly effectively. In particular, they satisfy four criteria of well-conceived goals: they’re <em class="emphasis">realistic</em> and <em class="emphasis">measurable</em>, and Joe has designated both <em class="emphasis">definite time frames</em> and <em class="emphasis">specific courses of action</em>.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-collins-fn14_028">Jack R. Kapoor, Les R. Dlabay, and Robert J. Hughes, <em class="emphasis">Personal Finance</em>, 8th ed. (New York: McGraw-Hill, 2007), 81.</span></p>

        </div>
        <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch14_s03_s02_p03">They’re also sensible. Joe sees no reason, for example, why he can’t pay off his car loan, credit card, and charge account balances within two years. Remember that, with no income other than student-loan money and wages from a part-time job, Joe has decided (rightly or wrongly) to use his credit cards to pay for much of his personal consumption (furniture, electronics equipment, and so forth). It won’t be an easy task to pay down these balances, so we’ll give him some credit (so to speak) for regarding them as important enough to include paying them among his short-term goals. After finishing college, he’ll splurge and take a month-long vacation. This might not be the best thing to do from a financial point of view, but he knows this could be his only opportunity to travel extensively. He is realistic in his classification of student loan repayment and the purchase of a home as long-term. But he might want to revisit his decision to classify saving for his retirement as a long-term goal. This is something we believe he should begin as soon as he starts working full-time.</p>

    <div class="section" id="collins-ch14_s03_s03">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Step 3: Develop a Budget and Use It to Evaluate Financial Performance</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch14_s03_s03_p01">Once he has reviewed his cash-flow statement, Joe has a much better idea of what cash flowed in for the year that ended August 31, 2008, and a much better idea of where it went when it flowed out. Now he can ask himself whether he’s satisfied with his annual inflow (income) and outflow (expenditures). If he’s anything like most people, he’ll want to make some changes—perhaps to increase his income, to cut back on his expenditures, or, if possible, both. The first step in making these changes is drawing up a personal <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">budget</a><span class="glossdef">A document that itemizes the sources of income and expenditures for a future period (often a year).</span></span>—a document that itemizes the sources of his income and expenditures for the coming year, along with the relevant money amounts for each.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch14_s03_s03_p02">Having reviewed the figures on his cash-flow statement, Joe did in fact make a few decisions:</p>
        <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="collins-ch14_s03_s03_l01">
            <li>Because he doesn’t want to jeopardize his grades by increasing his work hours, he’ll have to reconcile himself to just about the same wages for another year.</li>
            <li>He’ll need to apply for another $7,000 student loan.</li>
            <li>If he’s willing to cut his spending by $1,200, he can pay off his credit cards. Toward this end, he’s targeted the following expenditures for reduction: rent (get a cheaper apartment), phone costs (switch plans), auto insurance (take advantage of a “good-student” discount), and gasoline (pool rides or do a little more walking). Fortunately, his car loan will be paid off by midyear.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch14_s03_s03_p03">Revising his figures accordingly, Joe developed the budget in <a class="xref" href="#collins-ch14_s03_s03_f01">Figure 14.10 "Joe’s Budget"</a> for the year ending August 31, 2009. Look first at the column headed “Budget.” If things go as planned, Joe expects a cash surplus of $1,600 by the end of the year—enough to pay off his credit card debt and leave him with an extra $400.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch14_s03_s03_s01_p01">Now we can examine the two remaining columns in Joe’s budget. Throughout the year, Joe will keep track of his actual income and actual expenditures and will enter the totals in the column labeled “Actual.” Like most reasonable people, however, Joe doesn’t really expect his actual figures to match with his budgeted figures. So whenever there’s a difference between an amount in his “Budget” column and the corresponding amount in his “Actual” column, Joe records the difference, whether plus or minus, as a <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">variance</a><span class="glossdef">Difference between the actual amount and the budgeted amount.</span></span>. Two types of variances appear in Joe’s budget:</p>
            <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="collins-ch14_s03_s03_s01_l01">
                <li>
<em class="emphasis">Income variance</em>. When actual <em class="emphasis">income</em> turns out to be higher than expected or budgeted income, Joe records the variance as “favorable.” (This makes sense, as you’d find it favorable if you earned more income than expected.) When it’s just the opposite, he records the variance as “unfavorable.”</li>
                <li>
<em class="emphasis">Expense variance</em>. When the actual amount of an <em class="emphasis">expenditure</em> is more than he had budgeted for, he records it as an “unfavorable” variance. (This also makes sense, as you’d find it unfavorable if you spent more than the budgeted amount.) When the actual amount is less than budgeted, he records it as a “favorable” variance.</li>

        <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch14_s03_s04_p01">Before we leave the subject of the financial-planning process, let’s revisit the topic of Joe’s goals. Another look at <a class="xref" href="#collins-ch14_s03_s02_f01">Figure 14.9 "Joe’s Goals"</a> reminds us that, at the current stage of his financial life cycle, Joe has set fairly simple goals. We know, for example, that Joe wants to buy a home, but when does he want to take this major financial step? And of course, Joe wants to retire, but what kind of lifestyle does he want in retirement? Does he expect, like most people, a retirement lifestyle that’s more or less comparable to that of his peak earning years? Will he be able to afford both the cost of a comfortable retirement and, say, the cost of sending his children to college? As Joe and his financial circumstances mature, he’ll have to express these goals (and a few others) in more specific terms.</p>
        <div class="section" id="collins-ch14_s03_s04_s01">
            <h2 class="title editable block">Levels of Mature Goals</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch14_s03_s04_s01_p01">Let’s fast-forward a decade or so, when Joe’s picture of stages 2 and 3 of his financial life cycle have come into clearer focus. If he hasn’t done so already, Joe is now ready to identify a primary goal to guide him in identifying and meeting all his other goals.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-collins-fn14_029">See Bernard J. Winger and Ralph R. Frasca, <em class="emphasis">Personal Finance: An Integrated Planning Approach</em>, 6th ed. (Upper Saddle River, NJ: Prentice Hall, 2003), 57–58.</span> Suppose that because Joe’s investment in a college education has paid off the way he’d planned ten years ago, he’s in a position to target a primary goal of financial independence—by which he means a certain financially secure life not only for himself but for his children, as well. Now that he’s set this <em class="emphasis">primary</em> goal, he can identify a more specific set of goals—say, the following:</p>
            <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="collins-ch14_s03_s04_s01_l01">
                <li>A standard of living that reflects a certain level of comfort—a level associated with the possession of certain assets, both tangible and intangible.</li>
                <li>The ability to provide his children with college educations.</li>
                <li>A retirement lifestyle comparable to that of his peak earning years.</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch14_s03_s04_s01_p02">Having set this <em class="emphasis">secondary</em> level of goals, Joe’s now ready to make specific plans for reaching them. As we’ve already seen, Joe understands that plans are far more likely to work out when they’re focused on specific goals. His next step, therefore, is to determine the goals on which he should focus this next level of plans.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch14_s03_s04_s01_p03">As it turns out, Joe already knows what these goals are, because he’s been setting the appropriate goals every year since he drew up the cash-flow statement in <a class="xref" href="#collins-ch14_s03_s01_s02_f01">Figure 14.8 "Cash-Flow Statement"</a>. In drawing up that statement, Joe was careful to create several line items to identify his various expenditures: <em class="emphasis">housing, food, transportation, personal and health care, recreation/entertainment, education, insurance, savings</em>, and <em class="emphasis">other expenses</em>. When we introduced these items, we pointed out that each one represents a cash outflow—something for which Joe expected to pay. They are, in other words, things that Joe intends to <em class="emphasis">buy</em> or, in the language of economics, <em class="emphasis">consume</em>. As such, we can characterize them as <em class="emphasis">consumption goals</em>. These “purchases”—what Joe wants in such areas as housing, insurance coverage, recreation/entertainment, and so forth—make specific his secondary goals and are therefore his <em class="emphasis">third-level</em> goals.</p>

                <li>We can call the first category <em class="emphasis">present</em> goals because each item is intended to meet Joe’s present needs and those (we’ll now assume) of his family—housing, health care coverage, and so forth. They must be paid for as Joe and his family take possession of them—that is, when they use or consume them. All these things are also necessary to meet the first of Joe’s secondary goals—a certain standard of living.</li>
                <li>The items in the second category of Joe’s consumption goals are aimed at meeting his other two secondary goals: sending his children to college and retiring with a comfortable lifestyle. He won’t take possession of these purchases until some time in the <em class="emphasis">future</em>, but (as is so often the case) there’s a catch: they must be paid for out of <em class="emphasis">current</em> income.</li>

            <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch14_s03_s05_s01_p01">It’s tempting to glance at Joe’s budget and cash-flow statement and assume that he shares with most of us a common attitude toward saving money: when you’re done allotting money for various spending needs, you can decide what to do with what’s left over—save it or spend it. In reality, however, Joe’s budgeting reflects an entirely different approach. When he made up the budget in <a class="xref" href="#collins-ch14_s03_s03_f01">Figure 14.10 "Joe’s Budget"</a>, Joe <em class="emphasis">started out</em> with the decision to save $1,600—or at least to avoid spending it. Why? Because he had a goal: to be free of credit card debt. To meet this goal, he planned to use $1,200 of his <em class="emphasis">current</em> income to pay off what would continue to hang over his head as a <em class="emphasis">future</em> expense (his credit card debt). In addition, he <em class="emphasis">planned</em> to have $400 left over after he’d paid his credit card balance. Why? Because he had still longer-term goals, and he intended to get started on them early—as soon as he finished college. Thus his intention from the outset was to put $400 into savings.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch14_s03_s05_s01_p02">	In other words, here’s how Joe went about budgeting his money for the year ending August 31, 2008:</p>

                    <li>
                        <p class="para">Likewise, most people have two types of liabilities:</p>
                        <ol class="orderedlist" id="collins-ch14_s03_s05_s01_l06">
                            <li>Any debts that should be paid within one year are <em class="emphasis">current liabilities</em>.</li>

                    <li>Your <strong class="emphasis bold">net worth</strong> is the difference between your assets and your liabilities. <strong class="emphasis bold">Your net worth statement</strong> will show whether your net worth is on the plus or minus side on a given date.</li>
                    <li>In step 2 of the financial planning process, you create a <strong class="emphasis bold">cash-flow</strong> or <strong class="emphasis bold">income statement</strong>, which shows where your money has come from and where it’s slated to go. It reflects your financial status over a period of time. Your cash <em class="emphasis">inflows</em>—the money you have coming in—are recorded as <em class="emphasis">income</em>. Your cash <em class="emphasis">outflows</em>—money going out—are itemized as <em class="emphasis">expenditures</em> in such categories as housing, food, transportation, education, and savings.</li>
                    <li>A good way to approach your financial goals is by dividing them into three time frames: short-term (less than two years), intermediate-term (two to five years), and long-term (more than five years). Goals should be realistic and measurable, and you should designate definite time frames and specific courses of action.</li>
                    <li>Net worth and cash-flow statements are most valuable when used together: while your net worth statement lets you know what you’re worth, your cash-flow statement lets you know precisely what effect your spending and saving habits are having on your net worth.</li>
                    <li>If you’re not satisfied with the effect of your spending and saving habits on your net worth, you may want to make changes in future inflows (income) and outflows (expenditures). You make these changes in step 3 of the financial planning process, when you draw up your personal <strong class="emphasis bold">budget</strong>—a document that itemizes the sources of your income and expenditures for a future period (often a year).</li>

That’s because money invested at 7 percent compounded will double every ten years. Now, $64,000 may or may not seem like a significant return over fifty years, but after all, the money did all the heavy lifting, and given the miracle of compound interest, it’s surprising that Americans don’t take greater advantage of the opportunity to multiply their wealth by saving more of it, even in modest, interest-bearing accounts. Ironically, with $790 billion in credit card debt, it’s obvious that a lot of American families are experiencing the effects of compound interest—but in reverse.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-collins-fn14_031">Robert H.

A lot of Americans, it seems, do indeed set savings goals, but in one recent survey, nearly 70 percent of the respondents reported that they fell short of their monthly goals because their money was needed elsewhere. About one third of Americans say that they’re putting away something but not enough, and another third aren’t saving anything at all.

    <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch14_s04_p03">As we indicated in the opening section of this chapter, this shortage of savings goes hand in hand with a surplus in spending. “My parents,” says one otherwise gainfully employed American knowledge worker, “are appalled at the way I justify my spending.

        <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch14_s04_s02_p02">The repercussions? Banks and other institutions that made mortgage loans were the first sector of the financial industry to be hit. Largely because of mortgage-loan defaults, profits at more than 8,500 U.S. banks dropped from $35 billion in the fourth quarter of 2006 to $650 million in the corresponding quarter of 2007 (a decrease of 89 percent). Bank earnings for the year 2007 declined 31 percent and dropped another 46 percent in the first quarter of 2008.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-collins-fn14_042">Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, <em class="emphasis">Quarterly Banking Profile</em> (Fourth Quarter 2007), <a class="link" href="http://www.2.fdic.gov/qbp/2007dec/qbp.pdf">http://www.2.fdic.gov/qbp/2007dec/qbp.pdf</a> (accessed September 25, 2008); FDIC, <em class="emphasis">Quarterly Banking Profile</em> (First Quarter 2008), <a class="link" href="http://www.2.fdic.gov/qbp/2008mar/qbp.pdf">http://www.2.fdic.gov/qbp/2008mar/qbp.pdf</a> (accessed September 25, 2008).</span></p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch14_s04_s02_p03">Losses in this sector were soon felt by two publicly traded government-sponsored organizations, the Federal National Mortgage Association (Fannie Mae) and the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (Freddie Mac). Both of these institutions are authorized to make loans and provide loan guarantees to banks, mortgage companies, and other mortgage lenders; their function is to make sure that these lenders have enough money to lend to prospective home buyers. Between them, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac backed approximately half of that $12 trillion in outstanding mortgage loans, and when the mortgage crisis hit, the stock prices of the two corporations began to drop steadily. In September 2008, amid fears that both organizations would run out of capital, the U.S. government took over their management.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch14_s04_s02_p04">Freddie Mac also had another function: to increase the supply of money available for mortgage loans and new home purchases, Freddie Mac bought mortgages already written by lenders, pooled them, and sold them as mortgage-backed securities to investors on the open market. Many major investment firms did much the same thing, buying individual subprime mortgages from original lenders (such as small banks), pooling the projected revenue—payments made by the original individual home buyers—and selling securities backed by the pooled revenue.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch14_s04_s02_p05">But when their rates went too high and home buyers couldn’t make these payments, these securities plummeted in value. Institutions that had invested in them—including investment banks—suffered significant losses.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-collins-fn14_043">Shawn Tully, “Wall Street’s Money Machine Breaks Down,” <em class="emphasis">Fortune</em>, <em class="emphasis">CNNMoney.com</em>, November 12, 2007, <a class="link" href="http://money.cnn.com/magazines/fortune/fortune_archive/2007/11/26/101232838/index.htm">http://money.cnn.com/magazines/fortune/fortune_archive/2007/11/26/101232838/index.htm</a> (accessed September 25, 2008).</span> In September 2008, one of these investment banks, Lehman Brothers, filed for bankruptcy protection; another, Merrill Lynch, agreed to sell itself for $50 billion. Next came American International Group (AIG), a giant insurance company that insured financial institutions against the risks they took in loaning and investing money. As its policyholders buckled under the weight of defaulted loans and failed investments, AIG, too, was on the brink of bankruptcy, and when private efforts to bail it out failed, the U.S. government stepped in with a loan of $85 billion.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-collins-fn14_044">See Greg Robb et al., “AIG Gets Fed Rescue in Form of $85 Billion Loan,” <em class="emphasis">MarketWatch</em>, September 16, 2008, <a class="link" href="http://www.marketwatch.com/News/Story/aig-gets-fed-rescue-form/story.aspx?guid=%7BE84A4797%2D3EA6%2D40B1%2D9DB5%2DF07B5A7F5BC2%7D">http://www.marketwatch.com/News/Story/aig-gets-fed-rescue-form/story.aspx?guid=%7BE84A4797%2D3EA6%2D40B1%2D9DB5%2DF07B5A7F5BC2%7D</a> (accessed September 25, 2008).</span> The U.S. government also agreed to buy up risky mortgage-backed securities from teetering financial institutions at an estimated cost of “hundreds of billions.”<span class="footnote" id="fwk-collins-fn14_045">Mortgage Bankers Association, “Delinquencies and Foreclosures Increase in Latest MBA National Delinquency Survey,” Press Release, September 5, 2008, <a class="link" href="http://www.mbaa.org/NewsandMedia/PressCenter/64769.htm">http://www.mbaa.org/NewsandMedia/PressCenter/64769.htm</a> (accessed September 25, 2008).</span></p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch14_s04_s02_s01_p01">If you were one of the millions of Americans who took out subprime mortgages in the years between 2001 and 2005, you probably have some pressing financial problems. If you defaulted on your subprime ARM, you may have suffered foreclosure on your newly acquired asset, lost any equity that you’d built up in it, and taken a hit in your credit rating. (We’ll assume that you’re not one of the people whose eagerness to get on the subprime bandwagon caused fraudulent mortgage applications to go up by 300 percent between 2002 and 2006.)<span class="footnote" id="fwk-collins-fn14_046">Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, <em class="emphasis">Mortgage Loan Fraud: An Industry Assessment Based upon Suspicious Activity Report Analysis</em>, November 2006, <a class="link" href="http://www.fincen.gov/news_room/rp/reports/pdf/MortgageLoanFraud.pdf">http://www.fincen.gov/news_room/rp/reports/pdf/MortgageLoanFraud.pdf</a> (accessed September 26, 2008).</span></p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch14_s04_s02_s01_p02">On the other hand, you’ve probably learned a few lessons about financial planning and strategy. Let’s conclude with a survey of three lessons that you should have learned from your hypothetical adventure in the world of subprime mortgages.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch14_s04_s02_s01_p03"><em class="emphasis">Lesson 1: All mortgages are not created equal</em>. Despite (or perhaps because of) the understandable enticement of home ownership, your judgment may have been faulty in this episode of your financial life cycle. Generally speaking, you’re better off with a <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">fixed-rate mortgage</a><span class="glossdef">A mortgage on which the interest rate remains the same regardless of changes in market interest rates.</span></span>—one on which the interest rate remains the same regardless of changes in market interest rates—than with an ARM.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-collins-fn14_047">See Arthur J. Keown, <em class="emphasis">Personal Finance: Turning Money into Wealth</em>, 4th ed. (Upper Saddle River, NJ: Pearson Education, 2007, 253–54.</span> As we’ve explained at length in this chapter, planning is one of the cornerstones of personal-finances management, and ARMs don’t lend themselves to planning. How well can you plan for your future mortgage payments if you can’t be sure what they’re going to be?</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch14_s04_s02_s01_p04">In addition, though interest rates may go up or down, planning for them to go <em class="emphasis">down</em> and to take your mortgage payments with them doesn’t make much sense. You can wait around to get lucky, and you can even try to get lucky (say, by buying a lottery ticket), but you certainly can’t <em class="emphasis">plan</em> to get lucky. Unfortunately, the only thing you can really <em class="emphasis">plan</em> for is higher rates and higher payments. An ARM isn’t a good idea if you don’t know whether you can meet payments higher than your initial payment. In fact, if you have reason to believe that you can’t meet the <em class="emphasis">maximum</em> payment entailed by an ARM, you probably shouldn’t take it on.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch14_s04_s02_s01_p05"><em class="emphasis">Lesson 2: It’s risky out there</em>. You now know—if you hadn’t suspected it already—that planning your personal finances would be a lot easier if you could do it in a predictable economic environment. But you can’t, of course, and virtually constant instability in financial markets is simply one economic fact of life that you’ll have to deal with as you make your way through the stages of your financial life cycle.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch14_s04_s02_s01_p06">In other words, any foray into financial markets is risky. Basically, <em class="emphasis">risk</em> is the possibility that cash flows will be variable.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-collins-fn14_048">See esp. Arthur J. Keown et al., <em class="emphasis">Foundations of Finance: The Logic and Practice of Financial Management</em>, 6th ed. (Upper Saddle River, NJ: Pearson Education, 2008), 174.</span> Unfortunately, volatility in the overall economy is directly related to just one category of risks. There’s a second category—risks related to the activities of various organizations involved in your financial transactions. You’ve already been introduced to the effects of these forms of financial risk, some of which have affected you directly, some of which have affected you indirectly, and some of which may affect you in the future:<span class="footnote" id="fwk-collins-fn14_049">This section is based on Bernard J. Winger and Ralph R. Frasca, <em class="emphasis">Personal Finance: An Integrated Planning Approach</em>, 6th ed. (Upper Saddle River, NJ: Prentice Hall, 2003), 250–51.</span></p>
            <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="collins-ch14_s04_s02_s01_l01">
                <li>
<em class="emphasis">Management risk</em> is the risk that poor management of an organization with which you’re dealing may adversely affect the outcome of your personal-finances planning. If you couldn’t pay the higher rate on your ARM, managers at your lender probably failed to look deeply enough into your employment status and income.</li>
                <li>
<em class="emphasis">Business risk</em> is the risk associated with a product that you’ve chosen to buy. The fate of your mortgagor, who issued the original product—your subprime ARM—and that of everyone down the line who purchased it in some form (perhaps Freddy Mac and Merrill Lynch) bear witness to the pitfalls of business risk.</li>
                <li>
<em class="emphasis">Financial risk</em> refers to the risk that comes from ill-considered indebtedness. Freddie Mac, Fannie Mae, and several investment banks have felt the repercussions of investing too much money in financial instruments that were backed with shaky assets (namely, subprime mortgages).</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch14_s04_s02_s01_p07">In your own small way, of course, you, too, underestimated the pitfalls of all three of these forms of risk.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch14_s04_s02_s01_p08"><em class="emphasis">Lesson 3: Not all income is equally disposable</em>. <a class="xref" href="#collins-ch14_s04_s02_s01_f01">Figure 14.14 "Debt-Income Ratio"</a> shows the increase in the ratio of debt to disposable income among American households between 1985 and 2007. As you can see, the increase was dramatic—from 80 percent in the early 1990s to about 130 percent in 2007.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-collins-fn14_050">“Getting Worried Downtown,” <em class="emphasis">Economist.com</em>, November 15, 2007, <a class="link" href="http://www.economist.com/world/unitedstates/displaystory.cfm?story_id=10134077">http://www.economist.com/world/unitedstates/displaystory.cfm?story_id=10134077</a> (accessed September 27, 2008).</span> This rise was made possible by greater access to credit—people borrow money in order to spend it, whether on consumption or on investments, and the more they can borrow, the more they can spend.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch14_s04_s02_s01_p09">In the United States, greater access to credit in the late 1990s and early 2000s was made possible by rising housing prices: the more valuable your biggest asset, the more lenders are willing to lend you, even if what you’re buying with your loan—your house—<em class="emphasis">is</em> your biggest asset. As the borrower, your strategy is twofold: (1) Pay your mortgage out of your wage income, and (2) reap the financial benefits of an asset that appreciates in value. On top of everything else, you can count the increased value of your asset as <em class="emphasis">savings</em>: when you sell the house at retirement, the difference between your mortgage and the current value of your house is yours to support you in your golden years.</p>

From a peak in mid-2006, they had fallen 8 percent by November 2007, and by April 2008 they were down from the 2006 peak by more than 19 percent—the worst rate of decline since the Great Depression.

                <ul class="itemizedlist" id="collins-ch14_s04_s02_s01_l02">
                    <li>The <em class="emphasis">savings rate</em> measures the percentage of disposable income devoted to savings. The U.S. savings rate suffered a steep decline at the beginning of 2005 and late in the year actually slipped into the negative realm, at –0.5 percent of disposable income. In other words, Americans not only spent all of their disposable income but also dipped into their savings. In addition to Americans’ tendency to spend rather than save, the Federal Reserve observed that a lot of people had come to rely on the appreciation of such assets as stocks and residential property as a substitute for the practice of saving out of wage income.</li>
                    <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Subprime loans</strong> are made to would-be home buyers who don’t qualify for market-set interest rates because of one or more risk factors—income level, employment status, credit history, ability to make only a very low down payment. Interest rates may run from 8 percent to 10 percent and higher.</li>
                    <li>An <strong class="emphasis bold">adjustable-rate mortgage (ARM)</strong> is a home loan pegged to the increase or decrease of certain interest rates that the lender has to pay. If those rates go up, the mortgage rate and the home buyer’s monthly payments go up, too. A <strong class="emphasis bold">fixed-rate mortgage</strong> is a home loan on which the interest rate remains the same regardless of changes in market interest rates.</li>
                    <li>In the years between 2001 and 2005, lenders made billions of dollars in subprime ARM loans to American home buyers. In 2006 and 2007, however, housing prices started to go down. Homeowners with subprime ARM loans weren’t able to refinance, their mortgage rates began going up, and foreclosures became commonplace.</li>
                    <li>In 2006 and 2007, largely because of mortgage-loan defaults, banks and other institutions that made mortgage loans began losing huge sums of money. These losses carried over to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, publicly traded government-sponsored organizations that make loans and provide loan guarantees to banks and other mortgage lenders.</li>
                    <li>Next to be hit were major investment firms that had been buying subprime mortgages from banks and other original lenders, pooling the projected revenue—payments made by the original individual home buyers—and selling securities backed by the pooled revenue. When their rates went too high and home buyers couldn’t make their house payments, these securities plummeted in value, and the investment banks and other institutions that had invested in them suffered significant losses.</li>
