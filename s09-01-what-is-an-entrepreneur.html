    <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch05_s01_p01">In developing BTIO and Realityworks Inc., the Jurmains were doing what entrepreneurs do (and doing it very well). In fact, Mary was nominated three times for the Ernst &amp; Young Entrepreneur of the Year Award and named 2001 Wisconsin Entrepreneurial Woman of the Year by the National Association of Women Business Owners. So what, exactly, is an <em class="emphasis">entrepreneur</em>? What does an entrepreneur do? According to one definition, an entrepreneur is an “individual who starts a new business,” and that’s true as far as it goes. Another definition identifies an entrepreneur as someone who uses “resources to implement innovative ideas for new, thoughtfully planned ventures”<span class="footnote" id="fwk-collins-fn05_002">Canadian Foundation for Economic Education, “Glossary of Terms,” <em class="emphasis">Mentors, Ventures &amp; Plans</em> (2008), <a class="link" href="http://www.mvp.cfee.org/en/glossary.html">http://www.mvp.cfee.org/en/glossary.html</a> (accessed October 7, 2008).</span> which is also true as far as it goes. But an important component of a satisfactory definition is still missing. To appreciate fully what it is, let’s go back to the story of the Jurmains, for whom entrepreneurship seems to have worked out quite well. We hasten to point out that, in 1993, the Jurmains were both unemployed—Rick had been laid off by General Dynamics Corp., and Mary by the San Diego Gas and Electric Company. While they were watching the show about teenagers and flour sacks, they were living off a loan from her father and the returns from a timely investment in coffee futures. Rick recalls that the idea for a method of creating BTIO came to him while “I was awake in bed, worrying about being unemployed.” He was struggling to find a way to feed his family. He had to make the first forty simulators himself, and at the end of the first summer, BTIO had received about four hundred orders—a promising start, perhaps, but, at $250 per baby (less expenses), not exactly a windfall. “We were always about one month away from bankruptcy,” recalls Mary.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch05_s01_p02">At the same time, it’s not as if the Jurmains started up BTIO simply because they had no “conventional” options for improving their financial prospects. Rick, as we’ve seen, was an aerospace engineer, and his résumé includes work on space-shuttle missions at NASA. Mary, who has not only a head for business but also a degree in industrial engineering, has worked at the Johnson Space Center. Therefore, the idea of replacing a sack of flour with a computer-controlled simulator wasn’t necessarily rocket science for the couple. But taking advantage of that idea—choosing to start a new business and to commit themselves to running it—was a risk. <em class="emphasis">Risk taking</em> is the missing component that we’re looking for in a definition of <em class="emphasis">entrepreneurship</em>, and so we’ll define an <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">entrepreneur</a><span class="glossdef">Individual who identifies a business opportunity and assumes the risk of creating and running a business to take advantage of it.</span></span> as someone who identifies a business opportunity and assumes <em class="emphasis">the risk of creating and running a business</em> to take advantage of it.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">The Nature of Entrepreneurship</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch05_s01_s01_p01">If we look a little more closely at the definition of entrepreneurship, we can identify three characteristics of entrepreneurial activity:<span class="footnote" id="fwk-collins-fn05_003">Adapted from Marc J. Dollinger, <em class="emphasis">Entrepreneurship</em>: <em class="emphasis">Strategies and Resources</em>, 3rd ed. (Upper Saddle River, NJ: Prentice Hall, 2003), 5–7.</span></p>
        <ol class="orderedlist editable block" id="collins-ch05_s01_s01_l01">
            <li>
<em class="emphasis">Innovation</em>. Entrepreneurship generally means offering a new product, applying a new technique or technology, opening a new market, or developing a new form of organization for the purpose of producing or enhancing a product.</li>
            <li>
<em class="emphasis">Running a business</em>. A <em class="emphasis">business</em>, as we saw in <a class="xref" href="collins-ch01#collins-ch01">Chapter 1 "The Foundations of Business"</a>, combines resources to produce goods or services. Entrepreneurship means setting up a business to make a profit.</li>
            <li>
<em class="emphasis">Risk taking</em>. The term <em class="emphasis">risk</em> means that the outcome of the entrepreneurial venture can’t be known. Entrepreneurs, therefore, are always working under a certain degree of <em class="emphasis">uncertainty</em>, and they can’t know the outcomes of many of the decisions that they have to make. Consequently, many of the steps they take are motivated mainly by their confidence in the innovation and in their understanding of the business environment in which they’re operating.</li>
        </ol>
        <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch05_s01_s01_p02">It isn’t hard to recognize all three of these characteristics in the entrepreneurial experience of the Jurmains. They certainly had an <em class="emphasis">innovative</em> idea. But was it a <em class="emphasis">good</em> business idea? In a practical sense, a “good” business idea has to become something more than just an idea. If, like the Jurmains, you’re interested in generating income from your idea, you’ll probably need to turn it into a <em class="emphasis">product</em>—something that you can market because it satisfies a need. If—again, like the Jurmains—you want to develop a product, you’ll need some kind of organization to coordinate the resources necessary to make it a reality (in other words, a <em class="emphasis">business</em>). Risk enters the equation when, like the Jurmains, you make the decision to start up a business and when you commit yourself to managing it.</p>

                <p class="para" id="collins-ch05_s01_s02_s02_p02">Do you have what it takes to be an entrepreneur? To find out, start by reviewing the following list of characteristics commonly attributed to entrepreneurs:</p>
                <ul class="itemizedlist" id="collins-ch05_s01_s02_s02_l08">
                    <li>They are creative people who sometimes accomplish extraordinary things because they’re passionate about what they’re doing.</li>
                    <li>They are risk-taking optimists who commit themselves to working long hours to reach desired goals.</li>
                    <li>They take pride in what they’re doing and get satisfaction from doing something they enjoy.</li>
                    <li>They have the flexibility to adjust to changing situations to achieve their goals.</li>

                <p class="para" id="collins-ch05_s01_s02_s02_p03">We’ll also add that entrepreneurs usually start small. They begin with limited resources and build their businesses through personal effort. At the end of the day, their success depends on their ability to manage and grow the organization that they created to implement their vision.</p>
                <p class="para" id="collins-ch05_s01_s02_s02_p04">Now use the following three-point scale to indicate the extent to which each of these attributes characterizes you:</p>
                <ol class="orderedlist" id="collins-ch05_s01_s02_s02_l09">
                    <li>It doesn’t sound like me.</li>
                    <li>It sounds like me to a certain extent.</li>
                    <li>It sounds a lot like me.</li>
                </ol>
                <p class="para" id="collins-ch05_s01_s02_s02_p05">Based on your responses, do you think that you have the attributes of an entrepreneur? Do you think you could be a successful entrepreneur? Why, or why not?</p>
