Working from a prioritized list of customer names displayed on a computer screen, the salesperson clicks on a name to view relevant information about the customer, such as background and preferred casino activities. There’s even a printed script that can be used to guide the conversation. Such a system isn’t very helpful, however, to middle or top-level managers, who need systems to help them carry out their oversight and planning responsibilities. To design marketing programs, for instance, marketing managers rely on summary information gleaned from a dedicated customer-relationship management system. Let’s look at some of the widely available information systems designed to support people at the operational and upper-management levels.</p>

A <em class="emphasis">financial transaction</em> is an economic event: it affects the firm’s assets, is reflected in its accounting statements, and is measured in monetary terms. Sales of goods to customers, purchases of inventory from suppliers, and salaries paid to employees are all financial transactions. Everything else is a <em class="emphasis">nonfinancial transaction</em>. The marketing department, for example, might add some demographic data to its customer database. The information would be processed by the firm’s TPS, but it wouldn’t be a financial transaction.</p>

All these contingencies require immediate attention by a service attendant. In the past, service personnel strolled around looking for machines in need of fixing. Now, however, a downed slot machine sends out an “I need attention” signal, which is instantly picked up by a monitoring and paging system called MessengerPlus and sent to a service attendant.</p>

Using an EIS, for example, a gaming-company executive might simply touch a screen to view key summary information that highlights in graphical form a critical area of corporate performance, such as revenue trends.

Ever since the term was coined in 1956, AI has always seemed on the verge of being “the next big thing.” Unfortunately, optimistic predictions eventually collided with underwhelming results, and many experts began to doubt that it would ever have profitable applications.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-collins-fn15_011">“Artificial Intelligence,” <em class="emphasis">Webopedia</em>, <a class="link" href="http://www.webopedia.com/TERM/artificial_intelligence">http://www.webopedia.com/TERM/artificial_intelligence</a> (accessed June 2, 2006).</span> In the last decade, however, some significant advances have been made in AI—albeit in the area of game playing, where activities are generally governed by small sets of well-defined rules. But even the game-playing environment is sometimes complex enough to promote interesting developments. In 1997, for example, IBM’s Deep Blue—a specialized computer with an advanced chess-playing program—defeated the world’s highest-ranked player.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-collins-fn15_012">“Artificial Intelligence,” <em class="emphasis">Webopedia</em>, <a class="link" href="http://www.webopedia.com/TERM/artificial_intelligence">http://www.webopedia.com/TERM/artificial_intelligence</a> (accessed June 2, 2006).</span></p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch15_s03_s02_s04_p02">More recently, several AI applications have been successfully put to commercial use. Let’s take a brief look at two of these: <em class="emphasis">expert systems</em> and <em class="emphasis">face-recognition technology</em>.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="section" id="collins-ch15_s03_s02_s05">
            <h2 class="title editable block">Expert Systems</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch15_s03_s02_s05_p01"><span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Expert systems (ES)</a><span class="glossdef">Program that mimics the judgment of experts.</span></span> are programs that mimic the judgment of experts by following sets of rules that experts would follow. They’re useful in such diverse areas as medical diagnosis, portfolio management, and credit assessment. For example, you’ve called the customer-service department of your credit-card company because you want to increase your credit line. Don’t expect to talk to some financial expert who’s authorized to say yes or no. You’ll be talking to a service representative with no financial expertise whatsoever. He or she will, however, have access to an ES, which will give you an answer in a few seconds. How does it work? The ES will prompt the representative to ask you certain questions about your salary and living expenses. It will also check internal corporate data to analyze your purchases and payment behavior, and, based on the results, it will determine whether you get an increase and, if so, how much.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch15_s03_s02_s05_p02">At Harrah’s, an ES called the Revenue Management System helps to optimize the overall profitability of both hotel and casino operations. When a customer requests a room, the program accesses his or her profile in the database and consults certain “rules” for assessing the application.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-collins-fn15_013">John Goff, “Head Games: Businesses Deploying Analytical Software to Get a Better Fix on Customer Behavior,” <em class="emphasis">CFO Magazine for Senior Financial Executives</em> 20:9, July 1, 2004, <a class="link" href="http://www.cfo.com/article.cfm/3014815">http://www.cfo.com/article.cfm/3014815</a> (accessed June 2, 2006).</span> One rule, for example, might be: “If the customer has wagered more than $100,000 in the past year, add 10 points.” Eventually, the system decides whether your application will be accepted (and at what rate) by adding up points determined by the rules. While a tightwad may not get a room even when there are vacancies, a high roller may get a good rate on a luxury suite even if the hotel is nearly full.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch15_s03_s02_s06_p01">Harrah’s uses another particularly interesting, and sophisticated, application of AI. In the hotel-casino business, it’s crucial to identify and turn away undesirable visitors. One tool for this task is a digital camera-surveillance system that uses <em class="emphasis">face-recognition technology</em>. Using this technology, a program classifies a person’s face according to the presence/absence or extent of certain unique features, such as dimpled chins, receding jaws, overbites, and long or short noses. If there’s a match on, for example, fifteen features between a person being scanned and someone in the company database, a staff member decides whether the two people are the same. If a security manager then concludes that the face belongs to a skilled card-counter, the customer will be discouraged from playing blackjack; if it belongs to a known cheater, the individual will be escorted out of the casino. The system, however, does more than spot undesirables. It can also identify high rollers and send information about customers to managers on the floor. That’s why a Harrah’s manager can greet a preferred customer at the door with his favorite drink and a personalized greeting, such as “Hi, Bill! How’s Karen? Did you ever get that vintage Corvette?
