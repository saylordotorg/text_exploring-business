        <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch12_s04_s01_p01">Let’s fast-forward again and assume that your business—The College Shop—has just completed its second year of operations. After creating your second-year income statement, you decide to compare the numbers from this statement with those from your first statement. So you prepare the <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">comparative income statement</a><span class="glossdef">Financial statement showing income for more than one year.</span></span> in <a class="xref" href="#collins-ch12_s04_s01_f01">Figure 12.15 "Comparative Income Statement for The College Shop"</a>, which shows income figures for year 2 and year 1 (accountants generally put numbers for the most recent year in the inside column).</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch12_s04_s01_s01_p01">What does this statement tell us about your second year in business? Some things look good and some don’t. Your sales went up from $500,000 to $600,000 (a 20 percent increase—not bad). But your profit was down—from $30,000 to $18,000 (a bad sign). As you stare at the statement, you’re asking yourself the question: Why did my profit go down even though my sales went up? Does this result make sense? Is there some way of comparing two income statements that will give me a more helpful view of my company’s financial health? One way is called <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">vertical percentage analysis</a><span class="glossdef">Analysis of an income statement treating the relationship of each item as a percentage of a base (usually sales).</span></span>. It’s useful because it reveals the relationship of each item on the income statement to a specified base—generally sales—by expressing each item as a percentage of that base.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch12_s04_s01_s01_p02"><a class="xref" href="#collins-ch12_s04_s01_s01_f01">Figure 12.16 "Comparative Income Statement Using Vertical Percentage Analysis"</a> shows what comparative income statements look like when you use vertical percentage analysis showing each item as a percentage of sales. Let’s see if this helps clarify things. What do you think accounted for the company’s drop in income even though The College Shop sales went up?</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch12_s04_s01_s01_p03">The percentages help you to analyze changes in the income statement items over time, but it might be easier if you think of the percentages as pennies. In year 1, for example, for every $1.00 of sales, $0.55 went to pay for the goods that you sold, leaving $0.45 to cover your other costs and leave you a profit. Operating expenses (salaries, rent, advertising, and so forth) used up $0.35 of every $1.00 of sales, while interest and taxes took up $0.02 each. After you covered all your costs, you had $0.06 profit for every $1.00 of sales.</p>

            <h2 class="title editable block">Asking the Right Questions</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch12_s04_s01_s02_p01">Now, compare these figures to those for year 2. Where is the major discrepancy? It’s in <em class="emphasis">Cost of goods sold</em>. Instead of using $0.55 of every $1.00 of sales to buy the goods you sold, you used $0.64. As a result, you had $0.09 less ($0.64 – $0.55) to cover other costs. This is the major reason why you weren’t as profitable in year 2 as you were in year 1: your <em class="emphasis">Gross profit as a percentage of sales</em> was lower in year 2 than it was in year 1. Though this information doesn’t give you all the answers you’d like to have, it does, however, raise some interesting questions. Why was there a change in the relationship between <em class="emphasis">Sales</em> and <em class="emphasis">Cost of goods sold</em>? Did you have to pay more to buy goods for resale and, if so, were you unable to increase your selling price to cover the additional cost? Did you have to reduce prices to move goods that weren’t selling well? (If your costs stay the same but your selling price goes down, you make less on each item sold.) Answers to these questions require further analysis, but at least you know what the useful questions are.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch12_s04_s02_p01">Vertical percentage analysis helps you analyze relationships between items on your income statement. But how do you compare your financial results with those of other companies in your industry or with the industry overall? And what about your balance sheet? Are there relationships on this statement that also warrant investigation? Should you further examine any relationships between items on your income statement and items on your balance sheet? These issues can be explored by using <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">ratio analysis</a><span class="glossdef">Technique for financial analysis that shows the relationship between two numbers.</span></span>, a technique for evaluating a company’s financial performance.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch12_s04_s02_p02">First, remember that a <em class="emphasis">ratio</em> is just one number divided by another, with the result expressing the relationship between the two numbers.

        <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch12_s04_s02_p04">Ratio analysis is also used to assess a company’s performance over time and to compare one company to similar companies or to the overall industry in which it operates. You don’t learn much from just one ratio, or even a number of ratios covering the same period. Rather, the value in ratio analysis lies in looking at the <em class="emphasis">trend</em> of ratios over time and in comparing the ratios for several time periods with those of competitors and the industry as a whole. There are a number of different ways to categorize financial ratios. Here’s just one set of categories:</p>
        <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="collins-ch12_s04_s02_l01">

But how can you tell whether your gross profit margin for year 2 is appropriate for your company? For one thing, we can use it to compare The College Shop’s results to those of its industry. When we make this comparison, we find that the specialized retail industry (in which your company operates) reports an average gross profit margin of 41 percent. For year 1, therefore, we had a higher ratio than the industry; in year 2, though we had a lower ratio, we were still in the proverbial ballpark.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch12_s04_s02_s01_p03">It’s worthwhile to track gross profit margin, whether for your company or for companies that you might invest in or lend money to. In particular, you’ll gain some insight into <em class="emphasis">changes</em> that might be occurring in a business. For instance, what if you discover that a firm’s gross profit margin has declined? Is it because it’s costing more for the company to buy or make its products, or is it because its competition is forcing it to lower its prices?</p>

Even if you rent space, for example, you must still buy furniture and equipment. To have products on hand to sell, you need to tie up money in inventory. And once you’ve sold them, you may have money tied up in accounts receivable while you’re waiting for customers to pay you. Thus, investing in assets is a normal part of doing business. Managing your assets efficiently is a basic requirement of business success. Let’s look at a representative management efficiency ratio.

            <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch12_s04_s02_s03_p05">The College Shop was doing fine in year 1 (relative to the industry), but something happened in year 2 to break your stride. Holding onto inventory for an extra 9 days (67 days for year 2 minus 58 days for year 1) is costly. What happened? Perhaps inventory levels were too high because you overstocked. It’s good to have products available for customers, but stocking too much inventory is costly. Maybe some of your inventory takes a long time to sell because it’s not as appealing to customers as you thought. If this is the case, you may have a problem for the next year because you’ll have to cut prices (and reduce profitability) in order to sell the same slow-moving inventory.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch12_s04_s02_s03_p06">Optimal inventory turnover varies by industry and even by company. A supermarket, for example, will have a high inventory turnover because many of its products are perishable and because it makes money by selling a high volume of goods (making only pennies on each sale). A company that builds expensive sailboats, by contrast, will have a low inventory turnover: it sells few boats but makes a hefty profit on each one. Some companies, such as Dell Computer, are known for keeping extremely low inventory levels. Because computers are made to order, Dell maintains only minimal inventory and so enjoys a very high ratio of sales to inventory.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch12_s04_s02_s04_p01">“It takes money to make money,” goes the old saying, and it’s true. Even the smallest business uses money to grow. Management effectiveness ratios address the question: how well is a company performing with the money that owners and others have invested in it?</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch12_s04_s02_s04_p02">These ratios are widely regarded as the best measure of corporate performance. You can give a firm high marks for posting good profit margins or for turning over its inventory quickly, but the final grade depends on how much profit it generates with the money invested by owners and creditors. Or, to put it another way, that grade depends on the answer to the question: is the company making a sufficiently high return on its assets?</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch12_s04_s02_s04_p03">Like management efficiency ratios, management effectiveness ratios examine the relationship between items on the income statement and items on the balance sheet. From the income statement you always need to know the “bottom line”—net profit. The information that you need from the balance sheet varies according to the ratio that you’re trying to calculate, but it’s always <em class="emphasis">some measure of the amount of capital used in the business</em>. Common measures of capital investment include total equity, total assets, or a combination of equity and long-term debt. Let’s see whether The College Shop made the grade. Did it generate a reasonable profit on the assets invested in the company?</p>

In the second year, the company had $4.00 of current assets for every $1.00 of current liabilities. The average current ratio for the industry is 2.42. The good news is that The College Shop should have no trouble meeting its current obligations. The bad news is that, ironically, its current ratio might be too high: companies should have enough liquid assets on hand to meet current obligations, but not too many. Holding excess cash can be costly when there are alternative uses for it, such as paying down loans or buying assets that can generate revenue. Perhaps The College Shop should reduce its current assets by using some of its cash to pay a portion of its debt.</p>

                <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch12_s04_s02_s05_s02_p02">In year 1, the ratio of 1 indicates that The College Shop has an equal amount of equity and debt (for every $1.00 of equity, it has $1.00 of debt). But this proportion changes in year 2, when the company has more equity than debt: for every $1.00 of equity, it now has $0.85 in debt. How does this ratio compare to that of the industry? The College Shop, it seems, is heavy on the debt side: the industry average of 0.49 indicates that, on average, companies in the industry have only $0.49 of debt for every $1.00 of equity. Its high debt-to-equity ratio might make it hard for The College Shop to borrow more money in the future.</p>
                <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch12_s04_s02_s05_s02_p03">How much difference can this problem make to a business when it needs funding? Consider the following example. Say that you have two friends, both of whom want to borrow money from you. You’ve decided to loan money to only one of them. Both are equally responsible, but you happen to know that one has only $100 in the bank and owes $1,000. The other also has $100 in the bank but owes only $50. To which one would you lend money? The first has a debt-to-equity ratio of 10 ($1,000 debt to $100 equity) and the second a ratio of 0.50 ($50 debt to $100 equity). You—like a banker—will probably lend money to the friend with the better debt-to-equity ratio, even though the other one needs the money more.</p>
                <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch12_s04_s02_s05_s02_p04">It’s possible, however, for a company to make its interest payments comfortably even though it has a high debt-to-equity ratio. Thus, it’s helpful to compute the <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">interest coverage ratio</a><span class="glossdef">Financial ratio showing a company’s ability to pay interest on its debts from its operating income.</span></span>, which measures the number of times that a firm’s operating income can cover its interest expense.

But the real problem surfaces when you compare the firm’s interest coverage with that of its industry, which is much higher—14.5. This figure means that companies in the industry have, on average, $14.50 in operating income to cover each $1.00 of interest that it must pay. Unfortunately, The College Shop has only $3.30.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch12_s04_s03_p01">So, what have we learned about the performance of The College Shop? What do we foresee for the company in the future? To answer this question, let’s identify some of the basic things that every businessperson needs to do in order to achieve success:</p>
        <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="collins-ch12_s04_s03_l01">
            <li>Make a good profit on each item you sell.</li>
            <li>Move inventory: the faster you sell inventory, the more money you make.</li>
            <li>Provide yourself and others with a good return on investment: make investing in your business worthwhile.</li>
            <li>Watch your cash: if you run out of cash and can’t pay your bills, you’re out of business.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch12_s04_s03_p02">The ratios that we’ve computed in this section allow us to evaluate The College Shop on each of these dimensions, and here’s what we found:</p>
        <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="collins-ch12_s04_s03_l02">
            <li>Profit margin ratios (gross profit margin and net profit margin) indicate that the company makes a reasonable profit on its sales, though profitability is declining.</li>
            <li>One management efficiency ratio (inventory turnover) suggests that inventory is moving quickly, though the rate of turnover is slowing.</li>
            <li>One management effectiveness ratio (return on assets) tells us that the company generated an excellent return on its assets in its first year and a good return in its second year. But again, the trend is downward.</li>
            <li>Financial condition ratios (current ratio, total debt-to-equity, and interest coverage) paint a picture of a company heading for financial trouble. While meeting current bills is not presently a problem, the company has too much debt and isn’t earning enough money to make its interest payments comfortably. Moreover, repayment of a big loan in a few years will put a cash strain on the company.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch12_s04_s03_p03">What, then, does the future hold for The College Shop? It depends. If the company returns to year-1 levels of gross margin (when it made $0.45 on each $1.00 of sales), and if it can increase its sales volume, it might generate enough cash to reduce its long-term debt. But if the second-year decline in profitability continues, it will run into financial difficulty in the next few years. It could even be forced out of business when the bank demands payment on its long-term loan.</p>
