    <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch11_s05_p01">PowerSki founder and CEO Bob Montgomery spent sixteen years designing the Jetboard and bringing it to production. At one point, in his efforts to get the design just right, he’d constructed thirty different prototypes. Needless to say, this process took a very long time, but even so, Montgomery thought that he could handle the designing of the engine without the aid of a computer. Before long, however, he realized that it was impossible to keep track of all the changes.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Computer-Aided Design</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch11_s05_s01_p01">That’s when Montgomery turned to computer technology for help and began using a <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">computer-aided design (CAD)</a><span class="glossdef">System using computer technology to create models representing the design of a product.</span></span> software package to design not only the engine but also the board itself and many of its components. The CAD program enabled Montgomery and his team of engineers to test the product digitally and work out design problems before moving to the prototype stage.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch11_s05_s01_p02">The sophisticated CAD software allowed Montgomery and his team to put their design paper in a drawer and to start building both the board and the engine on a computer screen. By rotating the image on the screen, they could even view the design from every angle. Having used their CAD program to make more than four hundred design changes, they were ready to test the Jetboard in the water. During the tests, onboard sensors transmitted data to portable computers, allowing the team to make adjustments from the shore while the prototype was still in the water. Nowadays, PowerSki uses <em class="emphasis">collaboration software</em> to transmit design changes to the suppliers of the 340 components that make up the Jetboard.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Computer-Aided Manufacturing</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch11_s05_s02_p01">For many companies, the next step is to link CAD to the manufacturing process. A <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">computer-aided manufacturing (CAM)</a><span class="glossdef">System using computer technology to control production processes and equipment.</span></span> software system determines the steps needed to produce the component and instructs the machines that do the work. Because CAD and CAM programs can “talk” with each other, companies can build components that satisfy exactly the requirements set by the computer-generated model. CAD/CAM systems permit companies to design and manufacture goods faster, more efficiently, and at a lower cost, and they’re also effective in helping firms monitor and improve quality. CAD/CAM technology is used in many industries, including the auto industry, electronics, and clothing.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Computer-Integrated Manufacturing</h2>

CIM systems expand the capabilities of CAD/CAM. In addition to design and production applications, they handle such functions as order entry, inventory control, warehousing, and shipping.

        <h2 class="title editable block">Flexible Manufacturing Systems</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch11_s05_s04_p01">Finally, a CIM system is a common element in <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">flexible manufacturing systems (FMS)</a><span class="glossdef">System in which computer-controlled equipment is programmed to handle materials used in manufacturing.</span></span>, in which computer-controlled equipment can easily be adapted to produce a variety of goods. An FMS has immense advantages over traditional production lines in which machines are set up to produce only one type of good. When the firm needs to switch a production line to manufacture a new product, substantial time and money are often spent in modifying equipment. An FMS makes it possible to change equipment setups merely by reprogramming computer-controlled machines. Such flexibility is particularly valuable to companies that produce customized products.</p>
