        <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch07_s00_p01">Howard Schultz has vivid memories of his father slumped on the couch with his leg in a cast.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-collins-fn07_001">Introductory material on Howard Schultz and Starbucks comes from Howard Schultz and Dori Jones Yang, <em class="emphasis">Pour Your Heart into It: How Starbucks Built a Company One Cup at a Time</em> (New York: Hyperion, 1997), 3–8.</span> The ankle would heal, but his father had lost another job—this time as a driver for a diaper service. It was a crummy job; still, it put food on the table, and if his father couldn’t work, there wouldn’t be any money. Howard was seven, but he understood the gravity of the situation, particularly because his mother was seven months pregnant, and the family had no insurance.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch07_s00_p02">This was just one of the many setbacks that plagued Schultz’s father throughout his life—an honest, hard-working man frustrated by a system that wasn’t designed to cater to the needs of common workers. He’d held a series of blue-collar jobs (cab driver, truck driver, factory worker), sometimes holding two or three at a time. Despite his willingness to work, he never earned enough money to move his family out of Brooklyn’s federally subsidized housing projects. Schultz’s father died never having found fulfillment in his work life—or even a meaningful job. It was the saddest day of Howard’s life.</p>

But he did decide that if he was ever in a position to make a difference in the lives of people like his father, he’d do what he could. Remembering his father’s struggles and disappointments, Schultz has tried to make Starbucks the kind of company where he wished his father had worked. “Without even a high school diploma,” Schultz admits, “my father probably could never have been an executive. But if he had landed a job in one of our stores or roasting plants, he wouldn’t have quit in frustration because the company didn’t value him. He would have had good health benefits, stock options, and an atmosphere in which his suggestions or complaints would receive a prompt, respectful response.”<span class="footnote" id="fwk-collins-fn07_002">Howard Schultz and Dori Jones Yang, <em class="emphasis">Pour Your Heart into It: How Starbucks Built a Company One Cup at a Time</em> (New York: Hyperion, 1997), 138.</span></p>

They are its public face, and every dollar of sales passes through their hands.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-collins-fn07_005">Howard Schultz and Dori Jones Yang, <em class="emphasis">Pour Your Heart into It: How Starbucks Built a Company One Cup at a Time</em> (New York: Hyperion, 1997), 125.</span> According to Howard Schultz, they can make or break the company. If a customer has a positive interaction with an employee, the customer will come back. If an encounter is negative, the customer is probably gone for good. That’s why it’s crucial for Starbucks to recruit and hire the right people, train them properly, motivate them to do their best, and encourage them to stay with the company. Thus, the company works to provide satisfying jobs, a positive work environment, appropriate work schedules, and fair compensation and benefits. These activities are part of Starbucks’s strategy to deploy human resources in order to gain competitive advantage. The process is called <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">human resource management (HRM)</a><span class="glossdef">All actions that an organization takes to attract, develop, and retain quality employees.</span></span>, which consists of all actions that an organization takes to attract, develop, and retain quality employees. Each of these activities is complex. Attracting talented employees involves the recruitment of qualified candidates and the selection of those who best fit the organization’s needs. Development encompasses both new-employee orientation and the training and development of current workers. Retaining good employees means motivating them to excel, appraising their performance, compensating them appropriately, and doing what’s possible to retain them.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Human Resource Planning</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch07_s01_s01_p01">How does Starbucks make sure that its worldwide retail locations are staffed with just the right number of committed employees? How does Walt Disney World ensure that it has enough qualified “cast members” to provide visitors with a “magical” experience? How does Norwegian Cruise Lines make certain that when the <em class="emphasis">Norwegian Dawn</em> pulls out of New York harbor, it has a complete, fully trained crew on board to feed, entertain, and care for its passengers? Managing these tasks is a matter of <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">strategic human resource planning</a><span class="glossdef">Process of developing a plan for satisfying an organization’s human resource needs.</span></span>—the process of developing a plan for satisfying an organization’s human resources (HR) needs.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch07_s01_s01_p02">A strategic HR plan lays out the steps that an organization will take to ensure that it has the right number of employees with the right skills in the right places at the right times. HR managers begin by analyzing the company’s mission, objectives, and strategies. Starbucks’ objectives, for example, include the desire to “develop enthusiastically satisfied customers”<span class="footnote" id="fwk-collins-fn07_006">Starbucks Mission Statement,” <em class="emphasis">Starbucks.com</em>, <a class="link" href="http://www.starbucks.com/aboutus/environment.asp">http://www.starbucks.com/aboutus/environment.asp</a> (accessed May 6, 2006).</span> as well as to foster an environment in which employees treat both customers and each other with respect. Thus, the firm’s HR managers look for people who are “adaptable, self-motivated, passionate, creative team members.”<span class="footnote" id="fwk-collins-fn07_007">“Job Center,” <em class="emphasis">Starbucks.com</em>, <a class="link" href="http://www.starbucks.com/aboutus/jobcenter.asp">http://www.starbucks.com/aboutus/jobcenter.asp</a> (accessed May 6, 2006).</span> Likewise, Disney’s overall objectives include not only making all visitors feel as if they’re special in a special place but also ensuring that employees’ appearance reflects a special image (there’s even a forty-seven-page book on the subject).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-collins-fn07_008">“How Disney Puts the Magic in Recruiting,” <em class="emphasis">Vault</em>, <a class="link" href="http://www.vault.com/nr/newsmain.jsp?nr_page=3&amp;ch_id=400&amp;article_id=51875&amp;cat_id=1083">http://www.vault.com/nr/newsmain.jsp?nr_page=3&amp;ch_id=400&amp;article_id=51875&amp;cat_id=1083</a> (accessed May 6, 2006).</span> Disney looks for people who best fulfill these job requirements. The main goal of Norwegian Cruise Lines—to lavish passengers with personal attention—determines not only the type of employee desired (one with exceptionally good customer-relation skills and a strong work ethic) but also the number needed (one for every two passengers on the <em class="emphasis">Norwegian Dawn</em>).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-collins-fn07_009">“Overview of Careers on Cruise Ships,” <em class="emphasis">Career Prospects in Virginia</em>, <a class="link" href="http://www3.ccps.virginia.edu/career_prospects/briefs/PS/SummaryCruise.shtml">http://www3.ccps.virginia.edu/career_prospects/briefs/PS/SummaryCruise.shtml</a> (accessed May 6, 2006).</span></p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch07_s01_s01_s01_p01">To develop an HR plan, HR managers must obviously be knowledgeable about the jobs that the organization needs performed.

            <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch07_s01_s01_s02_p01">Once they’ve analyzed the jobs within the organization, HR managers must forecast future hiring (or firing) needs.

            <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch07_s01_s01_s02_p02">Starbucks, for instance, might find that it needs three hundred new employees to work at stores scheduled to open in the next few months. Disney might determine that it needs two thousand new cast members to handle an anticipated surge in visitors. The <em class="emphasis">Norwegian Dawn</em> might be short two dozen restaurant workers because of an unexpected increase in reservations.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch07_s01_s01_s02_p03">After calculating the disparity between supply and future demand, HR managers must draw up plans for bringing the two numbers into balance. If the demand for labor is going to outstrip the supply, they may hire more workers, encourage current workers to put in extra hours, subcontract work to other suppliers, or introduce labor-saving initiatives. If the supply is greater than the demand, they may deal with overstaffing by not replacing workers who leave, encouraging early retirements, laying off workers, or (as a last resort) firing workers.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Where to Find Candidates</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch07_s01_s03_p01">The first step in recruiting is to find qualified candidates. Where do you look for them, and how do you decide whether they’re qualified? Let’s start with the second part of the question first. A qualified person must be able to perform the duties listed in the job description and must possess the skills, knowledge, and abilities detailed in the job specification. In addition, he or she must be a good “fit” for the company. A Disney recruiter, for example, wants a candidate who fits a certain image—someone who’s clean-cut and “wholesome” looking. The same recruiter might also favor candidates with certain qualities—someone who has a “good attitude,” who’s a “go-getter” and a “team player,” and who’s smart, responsible, and stable.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-collins-fn07_012">Bob Nelson and Peter Economy, <em class="emphasis">Managing for Dummies</em>, 2nd ed.

            <h2 class="title editable block">Internal versus External Recruiting</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch07_s01_s03_s01_p01">Where do you find people who satisfy so many criteria? Basically, you can look in two places: inside and outside your own organization. Both options have pluses and minuses. Hiring internally sends a positive signal to employees that they can move up in the company—a strong motivation tool and a reward for good performance. In addition, because an internal candidate is a known quantity, it’s easier to predict his or her success in a new position. Finally, it’s cheaper to recruit internally. On the other hand, you’ll probably have to fill the promoted employee’s position. Going outside gives you an opportunity to bring fresh ideas and skills into the company. In any case, it’s often the only alternative, especially if no one inside the company has just the right combination of skills and experiences. Entry-level jobs usually have to be filled from the outside.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">How to Find Candidates</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch07_s01_s04_p01">Whether you search inside or outside the organization, you need to publicize the opening. If you’re looking internally in a small organization, you can alert employees informally. In larger organizations, HR managers generally post openings on bulletin boards (often online) or announce them in newsletters. They can also seek direct recommendations from various supervisors.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch07_s01_s04_p02">Recruiting people from outside is more complicated. It’s a lot like marketing a product to buyers: in effect, you’re marketing the virtues of working for your company. Starbucks uses the following outlets to advertise openings:</p>

Like most organizations, the FBI tests candidates on the skills and knowledge entailed by the job. Unlike most businesses, however, the FBI will also measure your aptitude, evaluate your personality, and assess your writing ability. You’ll have to take a polygraph (lie-detector) test to determine the truthfulness of the information you’ve provided, uncover the extent of any drug use, and disclose potential security problems.</p>

It serves the same purpose as it does for business recruiters: it allows the FBI to learn more about you and gives you a chance to learn more about your prospective employer and your possible future in the organization. The FBI conducts <em class="emphasis">structured interviews</em>—a series of standard questions. You’re judged on both your answers and your ability to communicate orally.</p>

You still have to pass a rigorous physical examination (including a drug test), as well as background and reference checks. Given its mission, the FBI sets all these hurdles a little higher than the average retail clothing chain. Most businesses will ask you to take a physical exam, but you probably won’t have to meet the fitness standards set by the FBI. Likewise, many businesses check references to verify that applicants haven’t lied about (or exaggerated) their education and work experience. The FBI goes to great lengths to ensure that candidates are suitable for law-enforcement work.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch07_s01_s06_p01">Though most people hold permanent, full-time positions, there’s a growing number of individuals who work at temporary or part-time jobs.

Most of them are independent contractors, consultants, or freelancers who are paid by the firms that hire them. Others are <em class="emphasis">on-call workers</em> who work only when needed. Still others are <em class="emphasis">temporary workers</em> (or “temps”) who are employed and paid by outside agencies or contract firms that charge fees to client companies.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch07_s01_s06_p02">The use of contingent workers provides companies with a number of benefits. Because they can be hired and fired easily, employers can better control labor costs. When things are busy, they can add temps, and when business is slow, they can release unneeded workers. Temps are often cheaper than permanent workers, particularly because they rarely receive costly benefits. Employers can also bring in people with specialized skills and talents to work on special projects without entering into long-term employment relationships. Finally, companies can “try out” temps: if someone does well, the company can offer permanent employment; if the fit is less than perfect, the employer can easily terminate the relationship. There are downsides to the use of contingent workers. Many employers believe that because temps are usually less committed to company goals than permanent workers, productivity suffers.</p>

On the plus side, you can move around to various companies and gain a variety of skills. You can see a company from the inside and decide up front whether it’s the kind of place you’d like to work at permanently. There are also some attractive lifestyle benefits. You might, for example, work at a job or series of jobs for, say, ten months and head for the beach for the other two. On the other hand, you’ll probably get paid less, receive no benefits, and have no job security. For most people, the idea of spending two months a year on the beach isn’t <em class="emphasis">that</em> appealing.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch07_s02_s02_p01">It would be nice if employees came preprogrammed with all the skills they need to do their jobs. It would also be nice if job requirements stayed the same: once you’ve learned how to do a job (or been preprogrammed), you’d know how to do it forever. In reality, new employees must be trained; moreover, as they grow in their jobs or as their jobs change, they’ll need additional training. Unfortunately, training is costly and time-consuming.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch07_s02_s02_p02">How costly? For every $1 in payroll that it spends, the consulting firm Booz Allen Hamilton invests almost $0.08 in employee training and development. At Pfizer, the world’s largest pharmaceutical company, the total is $0.14 out of every payroll dollar.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-collins-fn07_018">“Top 100: Top Five Profile and Rank,” <em class="emphasis">Training Magazine</em>, March 2004, 42.</span> What’s the payoff? Why are such companies willing to spend so much money on their employees? Pfizer, whose motto is “Succeed through People,” regards employee growth and development as its top priority. At Booz Allen Hamilton, consultants specialize in finding innovative solutions to client problems, and their employer makes sure that they’re up-to-date on all the new technologies by maintaining a “technology petting zoo” at its training headquarters. It’s called a “petting zoo” because employees get to see, touch, and interact with new technologies such as the Segway Human Transporter (a battery-operated vehicle that responds to the rider’s movements) even before they hit the market.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-collins-fn07_019">Tammy Galvin, “The 2003 Training Top 100,” <em class="emphasis">Training Magazine</em>, March 2003, 2.</span></p>

After you’ve passed a series of tests on the reading material, you’ll move behind the coffee bar, where a manager or assistant manager will give you hands-on experience in making drinks. According to the rules, you can’t advance to a new drink until you’ve mastered the one you’re working on; the process, therefore, may take a few days (or even weeks). Next, you have to learn enough about different types of coffee to be able to describe them to customers. (Because this course involves drinking a lot of coffee, you don’t have to worry about staying awake.) Eventually, you’ll be declared a coffee connoisseur, but there’s still one more set of skills to master: you must complete a customer-service course, which trains you in making eye contact with customers, anticipating their needs, and making them feel welcome.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-collins-fn07_021">Howard Schultz and Dori Jones Yang, <em class="emphasis">Pour Your Heart into It: How Starbucks Built a Company One Cup at a Time</em> (New York: Hyperion, 1997), 250–51.</span></p>

As you can see in <a class="xref" href="#collins-ch07_s02_s03_t01">Table 7.1 "Employment by Gender and Ethnic Group"</a>, more women and minorities have entered the workforce, and white males now make up only 37 percent of the workforce.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-collins-fn07_023">U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, “Occupational Employment in Private Industry by Race/Ethnic Group/Sex, and by Industry, United States, 2002,” <a class="link" href="http://www.eeoc.gov/stats/jobpat/2002/us.html">http://www.eeoc.gov/stats/jobpat/2002/us.html</a> (accessed May 6, 2006).</span> Their percentage representation diminished as more women and minorities entered the workforce.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch07_s02_s03_p02">Most companies today strive for diverse workforces. HR managers work hard to recruit, hire, develop, and retain a workforce that’s representative of the general population.

In addition, they can be the key to connecting with an ethnically diverse customer base. If a large percentage of your customers are Hispanic, it might make sense to have a Hispanic marketing manager.

Highly motivated employees focus their efforts on achieving specific goals; those who are unmotivated don’t. It’s the manager’s job, therefore, to motivate employees—to get them to try to do the best job they can. But what motivates employees to do well? How does a manager encourage employees to show up for work each day and do a good job? Paying them helps, but many other factors influence a person’s desire (or lack of it) to excel in the workplace. What are these factors? Are they the same for everybody? Do they change over time? To address these questions, we’ll examine four of the most influential theories of motivation: <em class="emphasis">hierarchy-of-needs theory, two-factor theory, expectancy theory</em>, and <em class="emphasis">equity theory</em>.</p>

Look, for instance, at the list of personal needs in the left-hand column. At the bottom are <em class="emphasis">physiological</em> needs (such life-sustaining needs as food and shelter). Working up the hierarchy we experience <em class="emphasis">safety</em> needs (financial stability, freedom from physical harm), <em class="emphasis">social</em> needs (the need to belong and have friends), <em class="emphasis">esteem</em> needs (the need for self-respect and status), and <em class="emphasis">self-actualization</em> needs (the need to reach one’s full potential or achieve some creative success).</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch07_s03_s01_p02">There are two things to remember about Maslow’s model:</p>
        <ol class="orderedlist editable block" id="collins-ch07_s03_s01_l01">
            <li>We must satisfy lower-level needs before we seek to satisfy higher-level needs.</li>
            <li>Once we’ve satisfied a need, it no longer motivates us; the next higher need takes its place.</li>
        </ol>
        <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch07_s03_s01_p03">Let’s say, for example, that you’ve just returned to college and that for a variety of reasons that aren’t your fault, you’re broke, hungry, and homeless. Because you’ll probably take almost any job that will pay for food and housing (<em class="emphasis">physiological</em> needs), you go to work repossessing cars. Fortunately, your student loan finally comes through, and with enough money to feed yourself, you can look for a job that’s not so risky (a <em class="emphasis">safety</em> need). You find a job as a night janitor in the library, and though you feel secure, you start to feel cut off from your friends, who are active during daylight hours. You want to work among people, not books (a <em class="emphasis">social</em> need). So now you join several of your friends selling pizza in the student center. This job improves your social life, but even though you’re very good at making pizzas, it’s not terribly satisfying. You’d like something that will let you display your intellectual talents (an <em class="emphasis">esteem</em> need). So you study hard and land a job as an intern in the governor’s office. On graduation, you move up through a series of government appointments and eventually run for state senator. As you’re sworn into office, you realize that you’ve reached your full potential (a <em class="emphasis">self-actualization</em> need) and you comment to yourself, “It doesn’t get any better than this.”</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch07_s03_s01_s01_p01">What implications does Maslow’s theory have for business managers? There are two key points: (1) Not all employees are driven by the same needs and (2) the needs that motivate individuals can change over time. Managers should consider which needs different employees are trying to satisfy and should structure rewards and other forms of recognition accordingly. For example, when you got your first job repossessing cars, you were motivated by the need for money to buy food. If you’d been given a choice between a raise or a plaque recognizing your accomplishments, you’d undoubtedly have opted for the money. As a state senator, by contrast, you may prefer public recognition of work well done (say, election to higher office) to a pay raise.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch07_s03_s02_p01">Another psychologist, Frederick Herzberg, set out to determine which work factors (such as wages, job security, or advancement) made people feel good about their jobs and which factors made them feel bad about their jobs. He surveyed workers, analyzed the results, and concluded that to understand employee <em class="emphasis">satisfaction</em> (or <em class="emphasis">dissatisfaction</em>), he had to divide work factors into two categories:</p>
        <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="collins-ch07_s03_s02_l01">
            <li>

            <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch07_s03_s02_s01_p01">We’ll ask the same question about Herzberg’s model as we did about Maslow’s: What does it mean for managers? Suppose you’re a senior manager in an accounting firm, where you supervise a team of accountants, each of whom has been with the firm for five years. How would you use Herzberg’s model to motivate the employees who report to you? Let’s start with hygiene factors. Are salaries reasonable? What about working conditions? Does each accountant have his or her own workspace, or are they crammed into tiny workrooms? Are they being properly supervised or are they left on their own to sink or swim? If hygiene factors like these don’t meet employees’ expectations, they may be dissatisfied with their jobs.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch07_s03_s02_s01_p02">As you can see in <a class="xref" href="#collins-ch07_s03_s02_f01">Figure 7.6 "Herzberg’s Two-Factor Theory"</a>, fixing problems related to hygiene factors may alleviate job <em class="emphasis">dissatisfaction</em>, but it won’t necessarily improve anyone’s job <em class="emphasis">satisfaction</em>. To increase satisfaction (and motivate someone to perform better), you must address motivation factors. Is the work itself challenging and stimulating? Do employees receive recognition for jobs well done? Will the work that an accountant has been assigned help him or her to advance in the firm? According to Herzberg, motivation requires a twofold approach: eliminating dissatisfiers and enhancing satisfiers.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch07_s03_s03_p01">If you were a manager, wouldn’t you like to know how your employees decide to work hard or goof off? Wouldn’t it be nice to know whether a planned rewards program will have the desired effect—namely, motivating them to perform better in their jobs? Wouldn’t it be helpful if you could measure the effect of bonuses on employee productivity?

            <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch07_s03_s03_s01_p01">To apply expectancy theory to a real-world situation, let’s analyze an automobile-insurance company with one hundred agents who work from a call center. Assume that the firm pays a base salary of $2,000 a month, plus a $200 commission on each policy sold above ten policies a month. In terms of expectancy theory, under what conditions would an agent be motivated to sell more than ten policies a month?</p>
            <ol class="orderedlist editable block" id="collins-ch07_s03_s03_s01_l01">
                <li>The agent would have to believe that his or her efforts would result in policy sales (that, in other words, there’s a positive link between effort and performance).</li>
                <li>The agent would have to be confident that if he or she sold more than ten policies in a given month, there would indeed be a bonus (a positive link between performance and reward).</li>
                <li>The bonus per policy—$200—would have to be of value to the agent.</li>
            </ol>
            <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch07_s03_s03_s01_p02">Now let’s alter the scenario slightly. Say that the company raises prices, thus making it harder to sell the policies. How will agents’ motivation be affected? According to expectancy theory, motivation will suffer. Why? Because agents may be less confident that their efforts will lead to satisfactory performance. What if the company introduces a policy whereby agents get bonuses only if buyers don’t cancel policies within ninety days? How will this policy affect motivation? Now agents may be less confident that they’ll get bonuses even if they do sell more than ten policies. Motivation will decrease because the link between performance and reward has been weakened. Finally, what will happen if bonuses are cut from $200 to $25? Obviously, the reward would be of less value to agents, and, again, motivation will suffer. The message of expectancy theory, then, is fairly clear: managers should offer rewards that employees value, set performance levels that they can reach, and ensure a strong link between performance and reward.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Equity Theory</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch07_s03_s04_p01">What if you spent thirty hours working on a class report, did everything you were supposed to do, and handed in an excellent assignment (in your opinion). Your roommate, on the other hand, spent about five hours and put everything together at the last minute. You know, moreover, that he ignored half the requirements and never even ran his assignment through a spell-checker. A week later, your teacher returns the reports. You get a C and your roommate gets a B+. In all likelihood, you’ll feel that you’ve been treated unfairly relative to your roommate.</p>

Applied to the work environment, this theory proposes that employees analyze their contributions or job inputs (hours worked, education, experience, work performance) and their rewards or job outcomes (salary, benefits, recognition). Then they create a contributions/rewards ratio and compare it to those of other people. The basis of comparison can be any one of the following:</p>
        <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="collins-ch07_s03_s04_l01">
            <li>Someone in a similar <em class="emphasis">position</em>
</li>
            <li>Someone holding a different position in the same <em class="emphasis">organization</em>
</li>
            <li>Someone with a similar <em class="emphasis">occupation</em>
</li>
            <li>Someone who shares certain <em class="emphasis">characteristics</em> (such as age, education, or level of experience)</li>
            <li>Oneself at another point in time</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch07_s03_s04_p03">When individuals perceive that the ratio of their contributions to rewards is comparable to that of others, they perceive that they’re being treated equitably; when they perceive that the ratio is out of balance, they perceive inequity. Occasionally, people will perceive that they’re being treated better than others. More often, however, they conclude that others are being treated better (and that they themselves are being treated worse). This is what you concluded when you saw your grade. You’ve calculated your ratio of contributions (hours worked, research and writing skills) to rewards (project grade), compared it to your roommate’s ratio, and concluded that the two ratios are out of balance.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch07_s03_s04_p04">What will an employee do if he or she perceives an inequity? The individual might try to bring the ratio into balance, either by decreasing inputs (working fewer hours, refusing to take on additional tasks) or by increasing outputs (asking for a raise). If this strategy fails, an employee might complain to a supervisor, transfer to another job, leave the organization, or rationalize the situation (perhaps deciding that the situation isn’t so bad after all). Equity theory advises managers to focus on treating workers fairly, especially in determining compensation, which is, naturally, a common basis of comparison.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch07_s04_s04_p01">You’ve undoubtedly noticed by now that many programs for balancing work and personal lives target married people, particularly those with children. Single individuals also have trouble striking a satisfactory balance between work and nonwork activities, but many single workers feel that they aren’t getting equal consideration from employers.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-collins-fn07_036">See Karen Collins and Elizabeth Hoover, “Addressing the Needs of the Single Person in Public Accounting,” <em class="emphasis">Pennsylvania CPA Journal</em>, June 1995, 16.</span> They report that they’re often expected to work longer hours, travel more, and take on difficult assignments to compensate for married employees with family commitments.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch07_s04_s04_p02">Needless to say, requiring singles to take on additional responsibilities can make it harder for them to balance their work and personal lives. It’s harder to plan and keep personal commitments while meeting heavy work responsibilities, and establishing and maintaining social relations is difficult if work schedules are unpredictable or too demanding. Frustration can lead to increased stress and job dissatisfaction. In several studies of stress in the accounting profession, unmarried workers reported higher levels of stress than any other group, including married people with children.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-collins-fn07_037">Data was obtained from 1988 and 1991 studies of stress in public accounting by Karen Collins and from a 1995 study on quality of life in the accounting profession by Collins and Jeffrey Greenhaus. Analysis of the data on single individuals was not separately published.</span></p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch07_s04_s04_p03">With singles, as with married people, companies can reap substantial benefits from programs that help employees balance their work and nonwork lives: they can increase job satisfaction and employee productivity and reduce turnover. PepsiCo, for example, offers a “concierge service,” which maintains a dry cleaner, travel agency, convenience store, and fitness center on the premises of its national office in Somers, New York. Single employees seem to find these services helpful, but what they value most of all is control over their time. In particular, they want predictable schedules that allow them to plan social and personal activities. They don’t want employers assuming that being single means that they can change plans at the last minute. It’s often more difficult for singles to deal with last-minute changes because, unlike married coworkers, they don’t have the at-home support structure to handle such tasks as tending to elderly parents or caring for pets.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Compensation and Benefits</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch07_s04_s05_p01">Though paychecks and benefits packages aren’t the only reasons why people work, they do matter. Competitive pay and benefits also help organizations attract and retain qualified employees. Companies that pay their employees more than their competitors generally have lower turnover. Consider, for example, The Container Store, which regularly appears on <em class="emphasis">Fortune</em> magazine’s list of “The 100 Best Companies to Work For.”<span class="footnote" id="fwk-collins-fn07_038">Robert Levering and Milton Moskowitz, “Special Report: The 100 Best Companies to Work For,” <em class="emphasis">Fortune</em>, January 12, 2004, 56–62.</span> The retail chain staffs its stores with fewer employees than its competitors but pays them more—in some cases, three times the industry average for retail workers. This strategy allows the company to attract extremely talented workers who, moreover, aren’t likely to leave the company. Low turnover is particularly valuable in the retail industry because it depends on service-oriented personnel to generate repeat business.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch07_s04_s05_p02">In addition to salary and wages, compensation packages often include other financial incentives, such as bonuses and profit-sharing plans, as well as benefits, such as medical insurance, vacation time, sick leave, and retirement accounts.</p>

The magnitude of bonuses still favors those at the top. High-ranking officers (such as CEOs and CFOs) often get bonuses ranging from 30 percent to 50 percent of their salaries. Upper-level managers may get from 15 percent to 25 percent and middle managers from 10 percent to 15 percent.

            <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch07_s04_s07_s03_p01">Like most <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">stock-option plans</a><span class="glossdef">Incentive program that allows eligible employees to buy a specific number of shares of company stock at a set price on a specified date.</span></span>, the TI plan gives employees the right to buy a specific number of shares of company stock at a set price on a specified date. At TI, an employee may buy stock at its selling price at the time when he or she was given the option. So, if the price of the stock goes up, the employee benefits. Say, for example, that the stock was selling for $30 a share when the option was granted in 2005. In 2007, it was selling for $40 a share. Exercising his or her option, the employee could buy TI stock at the 2005 price of $30 a share—a bargain price.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-collins-fn07_045">Texas Instruments, “Benefits,” <a class="link" href="http://www.ti.com/recruit/docs/profit.shtml">http://www.ti.com/recruit/docs/profit.shtml</a> (accessed May 6, 2006).</span></p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch07_s04_s07_s03_p02">At TI, stock options are used as an incentive to attract and retain top people. Starbucks, by contrast, isn’t nearly as selective in awarding stock options. At Starbucks, all employees can earn “Bean Stock”—the Starbucks employee stock-option plan. Both full- and part-time employees get options to buy Starbucks shares at a set price. If the company does well and its stock goes up, employees make a profit. CEO Howard Schultz believes that Bean Stock pays off: because employees are rewarded when the company does well, they have a stronger incentive to add value to the company (and so drive up its stock price). Shortly after the program was begun, the phrase “bean-stocking” became workplace lingo for figuring out how to save the company money.</p>

            <li>Legally required benefits (Social Security and Medicare, unemployment insurance, workers’ compensation)</li>

            <li>Insurance (health benefits, life insurance, disability insurance)</li>

        </ul>
        <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch07_s04_s08_p02">Unfortunately, the cost of providing benefits is staggering. According to the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, it costs an employer 42 percent of a worker’s salary to provide the same worker with benefits. So if you’re a manager making $100,000 a year, your employer is also paying out another $42,000 for your benefits. The most money goes for health care (15 percent of salary costs), paid time off (12 percent), and retirement benefits (6 percent).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-collins-fn07_046">U.S. Chamber of Commerce, “Chamber Survey Shows Worker Benefits Continue Growth,” January 2004, <a class="link" href="http://www.uschamber.com/press/releases/2004/january/04-07.htm">http://www.uschamber.com/press/releases/2004/january/04-07.htm</a> (accessed May 6, 2006).</span></p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch07_s04_s08_p03">Some workers receive only benefits required by law, including Social Security, unemployment, and workers’ compensation.

    <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch07_s05_p01">Employees generally want their managers to tell them three things: what they should be doing, how well they’re doing it, and how they can improve their performance. Good managers address these issues on an ongoing basis.

    <div class="section" id="collins-ch07_s05_s01">
        <h2 class="title editable block">The Basic Three-Step Process</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch07_s05_s01_p01">Appraisal systems vary both by organization and by the level of the employee being evaluated, but as you can see in <a class="xref" href="#collins-ch07_s05_s01_f01">Figure 7.9 "How to Do a Performance Appraisal"</a>, it’s generally a three-step process:</p>
        <ol class="orderedlist editable block" id="collins-ch07_s05_s01_l01">
            <li>Before managers can measure performance, they must set goals and performance expectations and specify the criteria (such as quality of work, quantity of work, dependability, initiative) that they’ll use to measure performance.</li>
            <li>At the end of a specified time period, managers complete written evaluations that rate employee performance according to the predetermined criteria.</li>
            <li>Managers then meet with each employee to discuss the evaluation. Jointly, they suggest ways in which the employee can improve performance, which might include further training and development.</li>

        <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch07_s05_s01_p02">It sounds fairly simple, but why do so many managers report that, except for firing people, giving performance appraisals is their least favorite task?<span class="footnote" id="fwk-collins-fn07_048">Susan Heathfield, “Performance Appraisals Don’t Work,” <em class="emphasis">About</em>, <a class="link" href="http://humanresources.about.com/cs/perfmeasurement/l/aa061100a.htm">http://humanresources.about.com/cs/perfmeasurement/l/aa061100a.htm</a> (accessed May 6, 2006).</span> To get some perspective on this question, we’ll look at performance appraisals from both sides, explaining the benefits and identifying potential problems with some of the most common practices.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch07_s05_s01_p03">Among other benefits, formal appraisals provide the following:</p>
        <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="collins-ch07_s05_s01_l02">
            <li>An opportunity for managers and employees to discuss an employee’s performance and to set future goals and performance expectations</li>

</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch07_s05_s01_p04">As for disadvantages, most stem from the fact that appraisals are often used to determine salaries for the upcoming year. Consequently, meetings to discuss performance tend to take on an entirely different dimension: the manager appears judgmental (rather than supportive), and the employee gets defensive. It’s the adversarial atmosphere that makes many managers not only uncomfortable with the task but also unlikely to give honest feedback. (They tend to give higher marks in order to avoid delving into critical evaluations.) HR professionals disagree about whether performance appraisals should be linked to pay increases. Some experts argue that the connection eliminates the manager’s opportunity to use the appraisal to improve an employee’s performance. Others maintain that it increases employee satisfaction with the process and distributes raises on the basis of effort and results.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-collins-fn07_050">Archer North &amp; Associates, “Reward Issues,” <em class="emphasis">Performance Appraisal</em>, <a class="link" href="http://www.performance-appraisal.com/rewards.htm">http://www.performance-appraisal.com/rewards.htm</a> (accessed May 6, 2006).</span></p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch07_s05_s02_p01">Instead of being evaluated by one person, how would you like to be evaluated by several people—not only those above you in the organization but those below and beside you? The approach is called <em class="emphasis">360-degree feedback</em>, and the purpose is to ensure that employees (mostly managers) get feedback from all directions—from supervisors, reporting subordinates, coworkers, and even customers. If it’s conducted correctly, this technique furnishes managers with a range of insights into their performance in a number of roles.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch07_s05_s02_p02">Some experts, however, regard the 360-degree approach as too cumbersome. An alternative technique, called <em class="emphasis">upward feedback</em>, requires only the manager’s subordinates to provide feedback. Computer maker Dell uses this approach as part of its manager-development plan. Every six months, forty thousand Dell employees complete a survey in which they rate their supervisors on a number of dimensions, such as practicing ethical business principles and providing support in balancing work and personal life. Like most companies using this technique, Dell uses survey results for development purposes only, not as direct input into decisions on pay increases or promotions.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-collins-fn07_051">Michele M.

Not only will the firm incur substantial costs to recruit and train a replacement, but it also may suffer temporary declines in productivity and lower morale among remaining employees who have to take on heavier workloads. Given the negative impact of <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">turnover</a><span class="glossdef">Permanent separation of an employee from a company.</span></span>—the permanent separation of an employee from a company—most organizations do whatever they can to retain qualified employees. Compensation plays a key role in this effort: companies that don’t offer competitive compensation packages (including benefits) tend to lose employees. But other factors come into play, some of which we discussed earlier, such as training and development, as well as helping employees achieve a satisfying work/nonwork balance. In the following sections, we’ll look at a few other strategies for reducing turnover and increasing productivity.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-collins-fn07_052">Gregory P.

Some have found that it pays to take their advice. When General Motors asked workers for ideas on improving manufacturing operations, management was deluged with more than forty-four thousand suggestions during one quarter.

Knowing why people are quitting gives an organization the opportunity to correct problems that are causing high turnover rates.</p>

Losing your job is what psychologists call a “significant life change,” and it’s high on the list of “stressful life events” regardless of the circumstances. Sometimes, employers lay off workers because revenues are down and they must resort to <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">downsizing</a><span class="glossdef">Practice of eliminating jobs to cut costs.</span></span>—to cutting costs by eliminating jobs.

            <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch07_s05_s05_s01_p01">Is it possible for you to get fired even if you’re doing a good job and there’s no economic justification for your being laid off? In some cases, yes—especially if you’re not working under a contract. Without a formal contract, you’re considered to be <em class="emphasis">employed at will</em>, which means that both you and your employer have the right to terminate the employment relationship at any time. <em class="emphasis">You</em> can quit whenever you want (which is good for you), but your <em class="emphasis">employer</em> can fire you whenever it wants (which is obviously bad for you).</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch07_s05_s05_s01_p02">Fortunately for you, over the past several decades, the courts have undercut employers’ rights under the <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">employment-at-will</a><span class="glossdef">Legal doctrine that allows an employer to fire an employee at will.</span></span> doctrine.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-collins-fn07_059">Charles J.

If it’s a case of poor performance, the employee is generally warned in advance that his or her current level of performance could result in termination. As a rule, managers give employees who have been warned a reasonable opportunity to improve performance. When termination is unavoidable, it should be handled in a private conversation, with the manager explaining precisely why the action is being taken.</p>

    <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch07_s06_p01">As we saw earlier, Maslow believed that individuals are motivated to satisfy five levels of unmet needs (physiological, safety, social, esteem, and self-actualization). From this perspective, employees should expect that full-time work will satisfy at least the two lowest-level needs: they should be paid wages that are sufficient for them to feed, house, and clothe themselves and their families, and they should have safe working conditions and some degree of job security. Organizations also have needs: they need to earn profits that will satisfy their owners. Sometimes, the needs of employees and employers are consistent: the organization can pay decent wages and provide workers with safe working conditions and job security while still making a satisfactory profit. At other times, there is a conflict—real, perceived, or a little bit of both—between the needs of employees and those of employers. In such cases, workers may be motivated to join a <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">labor union</a><span class="glossdef">Organized group of workers that bargains with employers to improve its members’ pay, job security, and working conditions.</span></span>—an organized group of workers that bargains with employers to improve its members’ pay, job security, and working conditions.</p>

    <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch07_s06_p03">Why the decline? Many factors come into play. For one thing, there are more women in the workforce, and they’re more likely to work part-time or intermittently. In addition, we’ve shifted from a manufacturing-based economy characterized by large, historically unionized companies to a service-based economy made up of many small firms that are hard to unionize.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-collins-fn07_061">U.S. Department of Labor, Bureau of Labor Statistics, “Union Members in 2003” January 2004, <a class="link" href="http://www.bls.gov/cps">http://www.bls.gov/cps</a> (accessed December 30, 2004); U.S. Department of Labor, Bureau of Labor Statistics, Union Members Summary, January 20, 2006, <a class="link" href="http://www.bls.gov/news.release/union2.nr0.htm">http://www.bls.gov/news.release/union2.nr0.htm</a> (accessed May 6, 2006).</span></p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Union Structure</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch07_s06_s01_p01">Unions have a pyramidal structure much like that of large corporations. At the bottom are <em class="emphasis">locals</em> that serve workers in a particular geographical area. Certain members are designated as <em class="emphasis">shop stewards</em> to serve as go-betweens in disputes between workers and supervisors. Locals are usually organized into <em class="emphasis">national unions</em> that assist with local contract negotiations, organize new locals, negotiate contracts for entire industries, and lobby government bodies on issues of importance to organized labor. In turn, national unions may be linked by a <em class="emphasis">labor federation</em>, such as the American Federation of Labor/Congress of Industrial Organizations (AFL/CIO), which provides assistance to member unions and serves as the principal political organ for organized labor.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section" id="collins-ch07_s06_s02">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Collective Bargaining</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch07_s06_s02_p01">In a nonunion environment, the employer makes largely unilateral decisions on issues affecting its labor force, such as salary and benefits. Management, for example, may simply set an average salary increase of 3 percent and require employees to pay an additional $50 a month for medical insurance. Typically, employees are in no position to bargain for better deals. (At the same time, however, for reasons that we’ve discussed earlier in this chapter, employers have a vested interest in treating workers fairly. A reputation for treating employees well, for example, is a key factor in attracting talented people.)</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch07_s06_s02_p02">The process is a lot different in a union environment. Basically, union representatives determine with members what they want in terms of salary increases, benefits, working conditions, and job security. Union officials then tell the employer what its workers want and ask what they’re willing to offer. When there’s a discrepancy between what workers want and what management is willing to give—as there usually is—union officials serve as <em class="emphasis">negotiators</em> to bring the two sides together. The process of settling differences and establishing mutually agreeable conditions under which employees will work is called <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">collective bargaining</a><span class="glossdef">Process by which management and union-represented workers settle differences.</span></span>.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch07_s06_s02_s01_p01">Negotiations start when each side states its position and presents its demands. As in most negotiations, these opening demands simply stake out starting positions. Both parties expect some give-and-take and realize that the final agreement will fall somewhere between the two positions. If everything goes smoothly, a tentative agreement is reached and then voted on by union members. If they accept the agreement, the process is complete and a contract is put into place to govern labor-management relations for a stated period. If workers reject the agreement, negotiators go back to the bargaining table.</p>

When unionized workers have complaints (such as being asked to work more hours than stipulated under their contract), they can call on union representatives to resolve the problem, in conjunction with supervisory personnel. If the outcome isn’t satisfactory, the union can take the problem to higher-level management. If there’s still no resolution, the union may submit the grievance to an arbitrator.</p>

            <h2 class="title editable block">Union Tactics</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch07_s06_s03_s01_p01">The tactics available to the union include <em class="emphasis">striking</em>, <em class="emphasis">picketing</em>, and <em class="emphasis">boycotting</em>. When they go on <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">strike</a><span class="glossdef">Union tactic by which workers walk away from their jobs and refuse to return until a labor-management dispute has been resolved.</span></span>, workers walk away from their jobs and refuse to return until the issue at hand has been resolved. As undergraduates at Yale discovered when they arrived on campus in fall 2003, the effects of a strike can engulf parties other than employers and strikers: with four thousand dining room workers on strike, students had to scramble to find food at local minimarkets. The strike—the ninth at the school since 1968—lasted twenty-three days, and in the end, the workers got what they wanted: better pension plans.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch07_s06_s03_s01_p02">Though a strike sends a strong message to management, it also has consequences for workers, who don’t get paid when they’re on strike. Unions often ease the financial pressure on strikers by providing cash payments. (Some unionized workers, by the way, don’t have the right to strike. Strikes by federal employees, such as air-traffic controllers, are illegal because they jeopardize the public interest.)</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch07_s06_s03_s01_p03">When you see workers parading with signs outside a factory or an office building (or even a school), they’re probably <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">picketing</a><span class="glossdef">Union tactic of parading with signs outside a factory or other facility to publicize a strike.</span></span>. The purpose of picketing is informative—to tell people that a workforce is on strike or to publicize some management practice that’s unacceptable to the union. In addition, because other union workers typically won’t cross picket lines, marchers can interrupt the daily activities of the targeted organization. How would you like to show up for classes to find faculty picketing outside the classroom building? In April 2001, faculty at the University of Hawaii, unhappy about salaries, went on strike for thirteen days. Initially, many students cheerfully headed for the beach to work on their tans, but before long, many more—particularly graduating seniors—began to worry about finishing the semester with the credits they needed to keep their lives on schedule.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-collins-fn07_062">“Hawaii Professors End Strike,” <em class="emphasis">USA Today</em>, June 19, 2001, <a class="link" href="http://www.usatoday.com/news/nation/2001-04-18-hawaii.htm">http://www.usatoday.com/news/nation/2001-04-18-hawaii.htm</a> (accessed May 6, 2006).</span></p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch07_s06_s03_s01_p04">The final tactic available to unions is <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">boycotting</a><span class="glossdef">Method used by union members to voice displeasure with certain organizations by refusing to buy the company’s products and encouraging others to follow suit.</span></span>, in which union workers refuse to buy a company’s products and try to get other people to follow suit.

In 2003, for example, at the request of two affiliates, the Actor’s Equity Association and the American Federation of Musicians, the AFL/CIO added the road show of the Broadway musical <em class="emphasis">Miss Saigon</em> to the list. Why? The unions objected to the use of nonunion performers who worked for particularly low wages and to the use of a “virtual orchestra,” an electronic apparatus that can replace a live orchestra with software-generated orchestral accompaniment.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-collins-fn07_063">Union Label and Service Department, AFL/CIO, “AFL-CIO National Boycott List,” November–December 2004, <a class="link" href="http://www.unionlabel.org/boycott.jsp">http://www.unionlabel.org/boycott.jsp</a> (accessed May 6, 2006).</span></p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch07_s06_s03_s02_p01">Management doesn’t sit by passively, especially if the company has a position to defend or a message to get out. One available tactic is the <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">lockout</a><span class="glossdef">Management tactic of closing the workplace to union workers.</span></span>—closing the workplace to workers—though it’s rarely used because it’s legal only when unionized workers pose a credible threat to the employer’s financial viability.

            <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch07_s06_s03_s02_p02">Lockout tactics were used in the 2004–2005 labor dispute between the National Hockey League (NHL) and the National Hockey League Players Association. When club owners and players failed to reach a salary agreement before the 2004 season, the owners imposed a lockout. Neither side would give in: the players wanted to retain a market-based salary system that let them negotiate salaries individually, while owners argued for a salary structure with some type of salary cap that would put a limit on total salaries. With the 2004–2005 season defunct, the NHL considered the option of declaring an impasse and bringing in replacement players (strikebreakers) for the next season. Though legally possible (at least in the United States), the action would certainly have been unpopular among the consumers of their product (the fans).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-collins-fn07_064">National Hockey League Labor Dispute (2004), <em class="emphasis">Wikipedia</em>, <a class="link" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Hockey_League_labor_dispute_(2004)">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Hockey_League_labor_dispute_(2004)</a> (accessed May 6, 2006).</span></p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">The Future of Unions</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch07_s06_s04_p01">As we noted earlier, union membership in the United States is declining. So, what’s the future of organized labor? Will membership continue to decline and unions lose even more power? The AFL/CIO is optimistic about union membership, pointing out recent gains in membership among women and immigrants, as well as health care workers, graduate students, and professionals.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-collins-fn07_065">AFL-CIO, “How &amp; Why People Join Unions,” <em class="emphasis">Unions 101</em>, <a class="link" href="http://www.aflcio.org/joinaunion/union101.cfm">http://www.aflcio.org/joinaunion/union101.cfm</a> (accessed May 6, 2006).</span></p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch07_s06_s04_p02">But convincing workers to unionize is still more difficult than it used to be and could become even harder in the future. For one thing, employers have developed strategies for dissuading workers from unionizing—in particular, tactics for withholding job security. If unionization threatens higher costs for wages and benefits, they can resort to part-time or contract workers. They can also outsource work, eliminating jobs entirely, and more employers are now investing in technology designed to reduce the amount of human labor needed to produce goods or offer services.</p>

        <p class="simpara"><strong class="emphasis bold">What’s Your (Emotional) IQ?</strong></p>
        <p class="para" id="collins-ch07_s07_p01">If you were an HR manager, on what criteria would you base a hiring decision—intelligence (IQ), education, technical skills, experience, references, or performance on the interview? All these can be important determinants of a person’s success, but some experts believe that there’s an even better predictor of success. It’s called <em class="emphasis">emotional intelligence</em> (or EI), and it gained some currency in the mid-1990s thanks to Daniel Goleman’s book <em class="emphasis">Emotional Intelligence: Why It Can Matter More Than IQ</em>. EI is the ability to understand both our own emotions and those of others, as well as the ability to use that understanding in managing our behavior, motivating ourselves, and encouraging others to achieve goals.</p>
        <p class="para" id="collins-ch07_s07_p02">An attractive aspect of EI is that, unlike IQ, it’s not fixed at an early age. Rather, its vital components—self-awareness, self-management, social awareness, and relationship management—can be strengthened over time. To assess your level of EI, go to the Web site maintained by the Hay Group, a management-consulting firm, and take the ten-item test that’s posted there (<a class="link" href="http://psychology.about.com/library/quiz/bl_eq_quiz.htm?questnum=6&amp;cor=2399">http://psychology.about.com/library/quiz/bl_eq_quiz.htm?questnum=6&amp;cor=2399</a>). After completing the test, you’ll get your EI score, some instructions for interpreting it, and an answer key.</p>
        <p class="para" id="collins-ch07_s07_p03">When you’ve finished with the test, rank the following items according to the importance that you’d give them in making a hiring decision: intelligence, education, technical skills, experience, references, interview skills, and emotional intelligence. Explain your ranking.</p>

        <p class="para" id="collins-ch07_s07_p07">Life couldn’t get much better for George O’Leary when he was named the head football coach at Notre Dame. Unfortunately, he barely had time to celebrate his new job before he was ruled ineligible: after just a week on the job, he was forced to resign, embarrassing himself, his family, his friends, and Notre Dame itself. Why? Because of a few lies that he’d put on his résumé twenty years earlier. To get the facts behind this story, go to the <em class="emphasis">Sports Illustrated</em> Web site (<a class="link" href="http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/football/college/news/2001/12/14/oleary_notredame">http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/football/college/news/2001/12/14/oleary _notredame</a>) and read the article “Short Tenure: O’Leary Out at Notre Dame After One Week.” Then, answer the following questions:</p>
        <ol class="orderedlist" id="collins-ch07_s07_l02">
            <li>Was O’Leary’s punishment appropriate? If you were the athletic director at Notre Dame, would you have meted out the same punishment? Why, or why not?</li>

            <li>Would his previous employer take him back?</li>
            <li>O’Leary was later hired as a head coach by the University of Central Florida. Will the episode involving his résumé undermine his ability to encourage players to act with integrity? Will it affect his ability to recruit players?</li>
